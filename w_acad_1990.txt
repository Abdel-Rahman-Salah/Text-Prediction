Section ISSUES When Allan Bloom wrote The Closing of the American Mind , he was probably not thinking of the " closed mind " under the image of a contraceptive . Still less would anyone be likely to think of the " open mind " that way . But such was precisely the image that seemed to govern a series of events at Princeton University this past year , which culminated in the dismissal of one of the official Catholic chaplains. 1 <p> C. John McCloskey is a young priest who belongs to Opus Dei ( the Work of God ) , a mixed lay-clerical organization founded in Spain in the 1920s with branches throughout the Catholic world . Opus Dei prides itself on its loyalty to the pope and its rigorous spiritual discipline . Some of its members were active in the Franco government in Spain , and the group has often been accused of having a conservative political ideology . Officially , Opus Dei states that it has no political position as such but that its members are free to engage in political activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opus Dei members are known to be politically active . <p> The group has for years been in the habit of establishing houses near elite universities , and seems to recruit new members primarily from such environments . ( There are degrees of affiliation , some of which are relatively loose . ) The group was active at Princeton as early as 1987 , and in 1989 it purchased a house just off campus to serve as its local headquarters . The purchase alarmed some Princetonians , indicating as it did that the organization intended to become a permanent presence at the university . <p> Almost from the beginning , rumors about the group and its alleged hidden agenda were circulated in both Catholic and non-Catholic circles in the community . Among liberal Catholics , Opus Dei has an image somewhat like that of the Masons in earlier times -- a malign secret organization with controlling tentacles moving in all directions . Little of this has ever been documented and , whatever the group may do in other parts of the world , it is clear that in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal piety . <p> From 1970 to 1988 the official Catholic chaplain at Princeton was Father Charles Weiser , a Trenton diocesan priest who directed the Aquinas Foundation . This organization is Princeton 's equivalent of the Newman Clubs elsewhere , and has its headquarters in a house once occupied by Thomas Mann . Weiser was appointed by the bishop of Trenton and was officially recognized by the university . By his own account , Weiser was at first cool to Opus Dei , and he describes his early encounters with McCloskey as less than friendly . Eventually however , he made the decision to appoint McCloskey an assistant director of the Aquinas Foundation , as much as anything , according to Weiser , " to keep an eye on him . " 2 <p> Shortly afterwards Weiser terminated official relations with another assistant chaplain , Jesuit Father Robert Ferrick , because of disagreements over Aquinas Foundation policies . Rather than accept Weiser 's policies , Ferrick left Princeton , but his departure caused a good deal of bitterness among his campus admirers . <p> Running through the dispute over Opus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is revealing that Ferrick 's most ardent admirers , who attended a weekly midnight Mass he celebrated , referred to themselves as " the Druids . " One of them , the left-wing journalist Gloria Emerson , noted : " Something remarkable must have been going on to get a Jewish undergraduate , a Puerto Rican methodist sic , and an agnostic together for a Catholic worship service . " 3 Ferrick himself , in his farewell message , listed his constituency as " Druids , chapel colleagues , black and Latino friends , those concerned with alcohol and drug abuse , the harassed , the marginal , the foreigner . " 4 Notably absent from the list were those he had been appointed primarily to serve : traditional Catholics . <p> Ferrick 's departure was the occasion for the first public attacks on Opus Dei , attacks notable for the fact that , in one of the major scholarly communities in the United States , they were made without any felt need to offer proof , not even to define terms . Thus Walter Murphy , a Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying Opus Dei had " Fascist ties . " 5 The closest Opus Dei 's critics ever came to offering proof of their charges of a malign hidden agenda was a frequent citing of the book The People of God : The Struggle for World Catholicism ( Viking , 1989 ) , by the late left-wing journalist Penny Lernoux , which claims that Opus Dei has been involved in various right-wing movements in Latin America . Lernoux was hardly a disinterested scholar , and Opus Dei officials pointed out that the organization had won a libel suit against her in a West German court . Her book , however , was cited over and over again as irrefutable evidence of Opus Dei 's sinister nature . <p> This alarm was fueled , within a community that prides itself on openness and rationality , by almost unlimited attention in both the campus and the community press to all the group 's critics , frequently citing the same people saying the same things over and over again . For a while no mention of Opus Dei in Princeton failed to recall that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman found murdered in the basement , despite the fact that this information had absolutely no bearing on the controversy . <p> For some months before the McCloskey case came to a boil , the press related how some Princeton Catholics were " worried " about the organization and its possible intentions , calling it " cult-like " and possessing a " right-wing reputation . " 6 Murphy alleged that Opus Dei had particularly " targeted " Ivy League universities , a charge which , if true , merely proved that it accepts those institutions ' own evaluation of their worth . Weiser , initially unsympathetic to Opus Dei , observed with some irony the behavior of highly rational academics : <p> The guy ( McCloskey ) was coming down here three times a week and people are paralyzed by anxiety . The immediate feeling I had was that they were acting like an elephant jumping on a chair trying to get away from a mouse . People were afraid Opus Dei was going to take over. 7 <p> Critics of McCloskey studiously avoided one inconvenient fact -- students and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was by no means clear that his critics outnumbered his supporters . The critics claimed , with considerable vehemence , that McCloskey 's approach to religion was inherently offensive and oppressive and , in case that fact was not known widely enough , gave it maximum publicity . But , if that was so , it seemed to follow that in a highly sophisticated community like Princeton , McCloskey 's approach would have little success and he would in time be forced to withdraw . What really bothered his critics , which for obvious reasons they could not admit , was that intelligent people , including undergraduates , did find his message attractive . The critics ' task , then , was to save such people from themselves . <p> The most vocal critic was an undergraduate named Robert Taliercio , a member of the left-wing religious group Pax Christi ( the Peace of Christ ) , who was one of those constantly referring to Opus Dei 's supposed " right-wing " political ties . Taliercio claimed to have attended an Opus Dei program in Spain one summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members lived in " very luxurious " surroundings. 8 If living in opulence is grounds for condemnation , it might be supposed that many Princeton students themselves would have to be damned . However , for all the talk about " right-wing " political ideology , no Princeton critic of Opus Dei ever reported any direct experience of this . No one claimed that McCloskey tried to influence his political views , or to recruit him into any kind of political activity , even on such identifiably " Catholic " issues as abortion . <p> Instead , a small number of students reported that they had been offended by McCloskey 's approach to what the Catholic Church calls " spirituality " or personal religious discipline . Some undergraduates ( no more than a half dozen were ever identified ) complained that he was " overly negative , " " rigid , " and " censorious , " which turned out to mean that he placed a good deal of emphasis on personal sin , warned students to avoid certain " occasions of sin , " and suggested that the larger world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely classical Christian doctrine ( once taught at Princeton and other Protestant schools ) and , if it is indeed unattractive to modern Americans , the problem , again , would have been self-correcting -- McCloskey would simply have failed in his mission . Thus critics were forced once more to avoid the central issue : that in a truly " pluralistic " environment Catholics were free to accept or reject McCloskey 's advice as they saw fit . Instead , they had to go through remarkable contortions to conceal the fact that they simply wanted church and university authorities to suppress an individual whose views they found personally distasteful . <p> Some attempt was made to imply that McCloskey had engaged in improper actions , such as a female student 's claim that he questioned her in the confessional about her sexual activities. 9 Allegedly , these improprieties had been reported to university authorities . The nadir of yellow journalism in the case was reached by the Trenton Times , which reported that evidence of these actions had been given to " university sources , who prefer to remain anonymous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action against them . " 10 The Times thus found it possible to insinuate serious improprieties on McCloskey 's part , to offer no proof , to claim that the evidence existed but was being suppressed , and to charge that the university had been intimidated by Opus Dei . ( If the university did indeed keep the complaints confidential for fear of legal action , a logical assumption might be that the complaints were unfounded and would not withstand scrutiny . ) <p> Unable to state frankly that they sought to suppress McCloskey 's opinions simply because they found them offensive , his critics next fell back on a relatively narrow point -- that he should not be allowed to represent the Aquinas Foundation , since it would officially associate the Catholic Church with his own allegedly distorted theology . But it was the prerogative of the foundation 's director , and ultimately of the bishop of Trenton , to decide who could enjoy official status in the chaplaincy . Weiser later stated that he had investigated every complaint against McCloskey and found no improprieties , even though he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The logic of the critics ' position was that no one who could be viewed as " controversial " ought to be given official status by the foundation , a contention they would hardly have defended under other circumstances ( Father Ferrick had also been highly controversial ) . A priest who , for example , might have offended some people by passionately supporting the Sandinistas in Nicaragua would in all likelihood be dubbed a " prophet " and praised for his courage . <p> The nub of the issue was half-consciously expressed by Taliercio when he accused Opus Dei of trying to " stamp out those who do not agree . " 11 But McCloskey was not demanding the expulsion from the Aquinas Foundation of those who did not support his views ; rather the reverse was the case . In effect his critics ' position was , " Opus Dei wants to suppress disagreement , so we have to suppress it first . " It was the dilemma of modern liberalism in a nutshell : is " tolerant pluralism " either tolerant or pluralistic enough to tolerate those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " tolerating " only those whose views are like its own ? <p> Taliercio said that he had originally been attracted to Opus Dei because " it provided security and it makes complicated lives very simple . Everything is black and white . You do n't have to think . " 12 It was a curious confession for an Ivy League student to make , prompting , as it did , the obvious question , " If you were so easily manipulated then , how do you know that you are really ' thinking ' right now ? " But it was also necessary to justify the exercise in liberal censorship -- those who accept the Opus Dei position allegedly do not do so with full freedom and understanding , and must be protected by those who know better . <p> In December 1989 , Suzi Landolphi , a professional comedienne , performed a routine at Princeton designed to promote both " safe sex " and feminism , which included such things as pulling a male student in front of a video camera , ordering him to say " vaginal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it got caught in your throat . " She also had female students stretch condoms over male students ' heads as a means of " desensitizing " the audience to contraceptives . McCloskey subsequently published a letter in the Daily Princetonian , the official campus newspaper , objecting that Landolphi viewed students as " salivating animals without any capacity for self-control . " 13 One student responded in a letter by accusing McCloskey of trying once more to " enslave " women with " the holy bond of matrimony " and of " keeping them barefoot , pregnant and in the kitchen , " an illogical charge given the fact that McCloskey was preaching chastity . The student concluded by suggesting that " perhaps the Princeton community . and society at large should advise McCloskey to take to drinking nothing but the semen of AIDS patients . " 14 <p> Earlier , McCloskey 's critics had met with the new director of the Aquinas Foundation , a Trenton diocesan priest named Vincent Keane , to demand McCloskey 's removal . Keane , who remained publicly noncommital , let it be known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for using the foundation 's name in his letter . <p> Following the " semen " letter it might have been thought that at least some of McCloskey 's critics would begin to wonder whether the tone of the debate was sinking lower than was proper for an elite university , but there is no evidence that they were embarrassed by such rhetoric . In some ways the essence of the matter was stated by another student letter-writer , who explicitly denied that Opus Dei was entitled to the toleration of a " pluralistic , open society " on the grounds that " their agenda is to establish a universal hegemonic view . " The writer concluded . " In a plural , liberal democracy , McCloskey is allowed to spread his AIDS : Assault on Inquiry , Discourses , and Speech . But we have our contraceptives : open minds . " 15 The Landolphi incident revealed most clearly that the real opposition to Opus Dei , therefore , was not over its alleged " right-wing " political ties , but over sexual " liberation , " and McCloskey was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " because he dared to disagree publicly with current conventional wisdom . Intellectual freedom was explicitly described as a " contraceptive , " the purpose of which is to exclude consideration of unfashionable views . <p> That sexual orthodoxy was the root of the tension between McCloskey and some in the Princeton community was confirmed when the G. K. Chesterton Society sponsored a talk by Maggie Gallagher , the author of a book arguing that women have been exploited by the sexual revolution . Gallagher faced a partially hostile audience , which at one point pelted the stage with condoms . A feminist student published a review of the speech which stopped just short of saying that Gallagher should have been barred from campus , arguing that she appeared under false pretenses , since she failed to acknowledge that she supported " patriarchy. " 16 The Chesterton Society was then accused of being an Opus Dei front organization founded to give the group unmerited intellectual respectability , although members pointed out that only some of them were affiliated with Opus Dei . <p> McCloskey 's defenders soon found themselves in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth yet another barrage of attacks , which widened to include not only McCloskey but any student who dared to defend him . The techniques were classic McCarthyism : ceaselessly repeated charges offered without proof , unsubstantiated claims often by unnamed people , hints about confidential evidence which was being suppressed . Opus Dei found itself in the impossible situation of having to say , in effect , over and over again : " We are not a cult . " <p> McCloskey 's critics repeatedly criticized the Aquinas Foundation and the university for not investigating their charges . But Luis Tellez , head of Opus Dei 's Princeton house , pointed out that no one had ever filed a formal complaint against McCloskey with the university authorities , which would have resulted in an investigation in which McCloskey could have defended himself . The critics ' weapon was primarily an unceasing propaganda barrage , and they seem to have calculated ( correctly , as it turned out ) , that such an assault would eventually achieve their goal without the obligation of having to prove their charges in any rigorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning matters of sexual behavior , the critics began claiming that he had warned students against taking particular courses and prohibited them from reading particular books , and that Opus Dei members themselves are forbidden to read certain works . They therefore asserted that McCloskey 's approach to education was fundamentally at odds with the nature of the university . McCloskey , in turn , claimed that the allegations were untrue or highly distorted . The only " smoking gun " the critics could find , which they attempted to establish as the murder weapon , was a memo from the priest listing about forty " courses of possible interest from a Christian culture viewpoint at Princeton University . " 17 The list was drawn directly from the university catalogue and included nine academic departments , its net cast wide enough to include both " The Religion of Islam " and " The Origins of Modern Science . " Criticism centered on a note appended to the list : " Remember everything depends on the outlook of the teacher giving the course . The latter may seem quite interesting and stimulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact is counter-productive . " This warning , critics trumpeted , was censorship of the worst kind and in violation of the very nature of free inquiry . <p> But no critic even alleged that McCloskey 's list omitted courses that should have been included , which would have been the obvious way of " censoring " courses the priest thought unacceptable , and on the face of it the list was a recommendation , not a condemnation . McCloskey gave no indication which courses , if any , he considered " anti-Christian , " and his warning was no different from the kind feminists and militant ethnic minorities issue all the time on university campuses . Thus critics were in the position to assert that McCloskey had no right to evaluate university courses , no matter how mildly or obliquely , a curious understanding of the nature of free inquiry . <p> At the end of last March , six students circulated an open letter to the Princeton community accusing McCloskey of using the tactics of " intimidation " and claiming that his presence on campus was detrimental to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their names appended to the list , not all of them Catholics . ( Although McCloskey 's critics portrayed him as fostering ignorance , in contrast to those like themselves who valued knowledge , their publicity was consistently marred by elementary errors . Thus , on their petition the name of the historian Carl Schorske was spelled " Scherske , " and one student claimed that McCloskey had warned her against reading " Bertram " Russell . ) <p> Tellez issued a detailed response to the petition , mentioning , among other things , the libel suit against Penny Lernoux and the fact that no formal complaint against McCloskey had been lodged with the university ; he also said that certain statements attributed to McCloskey were not authentic . McCloskey 's defenders were at a constant disadvantage , however , since his critics used each defense merely as an occasion to mount the same charges even more aggressively , a tactic which both the university and the community press were more than willing to permit . <p> Keane , who had met with twenty people demanding McCloskey 's ouster , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had " no right " to warn students about " anti-Christian " courses. 19 Keane cited his own experience as a college professor ( of speech pathology ) to justify his judgment , apparently an act of professional solidarity with professors for whom freedom includes immunity from criticism . The Daily Princetonian , after giving McCloskey 's critics maximum publicity for months , now formally sided with those critics in an editorial decreeing that the " Opus Dei group should be allowed to preserve its religious identity -- but only to the extent that its practices do not intrude upon the university 's academic mission . " 20 Both this statement and Keane 's seemed to imply that academic freedom includes professors ' immunity from " outside " criticism . The Princetonian 's formula also seemed to imply that Opus Dei 's preservation of its religious identity is a privilege granted by the university . <p> In April , Keane announced that McCloskey would not be returning to the Aquinas Foundation in the fall , a decision McCloskey said had been conveyed to him in December , the time of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approximately nine hundred Catholic students on campus had signed the petition against him , and categorically denied their charges . The Princetonian article announcing his dismissal was a comedy of errors which scarcely bolstered the claim that McCloskey 's critics represented responsible scholarship . Keane appeared to be advocating affirmative action for Hawaiians when he was quoted as saying that he hoped to replace McCloskey with a " lei woman , " and the student paper identified Keane 's photograph as McCloskey 's , giving rise to a deliciously wicked fantasy on the part of McCloskey 's supporters , that of posting copies of the paper all over campus with the notation , " This man has been officially found to be dangerous to students . If you see him on campus , detain him and call the police . " <p> Now , even the claim by McCloskey 's critics that the issue was the relatively narrow one of whether he ought to be officially associated with the Aquinas Foundation was belied when , following the announcement of his " non-renewal , " they continued to press for a university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air the same charges against him . <p> Keane 's action in surrendering to McCloskey 's critics was curious in part because of their increasingly frank agenda . One student writing for the Princetonian accepted Opus Dei 's claim to loyalty to the pope but asserted that " good Catholics " need pay no attention to him. 21 One leader of the anti-McCloskey faction , who published a lengthy attack against him , signed a pro-abortion advertisement in the Princetonian. 22 However , when Weiser wrote a letter to the newspaper arguing that McCloskey had been mistreated , it was not published . ( The letter later appeared in a conservative student publication , the Princeton Sentinel , in a summary of the case in which several of the students who signed the petition against McCloskey admitted that they never met him and had signed at the urging of their friends. ) 23 <p> McCloskey and Opus Dei intend to remain active in Princeton , and McCloskey has said that his exclusion from the Aquinas Foundation might actually make his work easier . The pastor of St. Paul 's Catholic Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board member of the Aquinas Foundation who said he was not consulted about McCloskey 's removal , has commented : " It seems that a little orthodoxy scares a lot of people . " 24 Princeton University itself seems to bear little responsibility for what happened to the priest . There is no evidence that the university sought his removal , although the few officials who spoke publicly mildly criticized McCloskey . Primary responsibility rests with Keane , who appears to have decided simply to buy peace . Even if every single charge against McCloskey were true , his comments and actions were within the bounds of what is usually defined as academic freedom . Ironically , in the future , those in the Princeton community . inclined to think that Catholic officials fail to respect this freedom have only to look at the treatment accorded John McCloskey to find prime evidence for their thesis . <p> 
##4000351 Section : REPORTS FROM THE ACADEMY PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> -- Alexander Pope <p> My association with the English department at Duke University began in 1971 . Having taken my bachelor 's and master 's degrees at the University of Tennessee , I was looking for a place to study for the doctorate , and was interested in a change in academic scenery . As I considered various programs , Duke University kept surfacing as a particularly attractive choice . It was small , but not too small ; it had educated two of my best undergraduate professors ; its library was spectacularly fine ; and with its gothic architectural splendor and lush gardens it was the most beautiful place I had ever seen . Furthermore , in my English studies thus far , I had often found Duke scholars such as Allan Gilbert on Dante and the Renaissance , Benjamin Boyce on eighteenth-century culture , Newman I. White on Shelley , and Lionel Stevenson , C. R. Sanders , and Paull F. Baum on Victorian literature particularly valuable . Their work was thorough , serious , and solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something new and worthwhile . <p> I entered the doctoral program at Duke , concentrating primarily on eighteenth- and nineteenth-century English literature ; and after taking my Ph.D . in 1975 , moved on to the University of Rochester as an Andrew Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow . Thus began a career that has taken me to a number of institutions , given me a chance to write , teach , and chair ( for perhaps too many years ) an English department , and generally has allowed me to experience the kinds of ups and downs usually associated with an academic career . Through it all , I found that my training at Duke served me well . Duke could not , of course , strike brilliance from such ordinary stuff as I , but it did give me a thorough grounding in the English language and English literary history , and an exposure to a very broad range of English , American , and " world " literature . It also instilled in me the sense that however important " the profession " and my own career might be to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature and culture were much more so , and moreover , quite transcended in significance the relatively small world of American academic life . <p> After 1975 I had little contact with affairs at Duke . Then , in the fall of 1983 , I received a Duke University English Newsletter , a publication promising to be the first in an " on-going semi-annual enterprise to keep alumni and friends of the Department up to date on what 's going on in the Department . " My first , perhaps naive , response was one of at least mild pleasure . Learning about the goings-on in one 's old graduate program seemed innocent enough , though I do remember thinking that the rather slickly produced publication seemed just a bit vulgar and out of key with the Duke I had known . In my time , self-advertisement was viewed with something like disdain , and we graduate students joked that the classic departmental recommendation was the one-sentence statement that a given candidate was " not without redeeming virtue . " Well , this chirpy little newsletter was a far cry from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole inoffensive . It listed the current departmental faculty , with a paragraph about each professor 's background and publications . At the end of this section , however , I came bolt upon the following : <p> We hope that it is our humanness , as well as our professional achievements , that will come to the fore in future issues of the Newsletter -- enough so , at least , to make you want to read about who and what we are , what we do , what we think , and even what we 're like when we are outside the hallowed halls of academe . <p> Perhaps I was too sensitive , but this statement positively jarred . Just what did they mean by " humanness " ? I was certainly far from convinced that , whatever it might be , it could be communicated in a six-page newsletter . Suspecting them of cant , I thought they rather expected more interest in them personally than was warranted . <p> If I detected something self-serving and self-important in that statement , some of my fears were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a " successful " " Duke Writers ' Conference " was discussed , which " attracted national attention " ( apparently a mention in the New York Times ) , held " rigorous workshops , " and created a " rich environment . " Another item noted a ( predictably ) " successful " Association of Departments of English meeting held at Duke having " virtues other than statistical " and featuring papers " exhibiting gratifying qualifies of mutual admiration . " It was concluded that " the most fortunate departments are those at small , private universities " -- like Duke , no doubt . The issue closed with the revelation that the Ph.D . no longer required " historical distribution . " Now each program would be " shaped by the individual student , " and Ph.D . courses " spoke more directly to the students ' courses of concentrated study , " and were " extremely popular . " <p> Here , I began to see two features that would become all too characteristic of subsequent issues : an emphasis on publicity as opposed to intellectual value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the department 's favor . The newsletter , I would soon realize , seldom reported anything without first assuring the reader it was " excellent , " " successful , " " the best , " or " important . " This left the unsettling impression that self-congratulation , publicity-seeking , and a very dubious curricular " freedom " had become the order of the day . <p> The Spring 1984 issue contained a rather bland section on the journals published by the department . Although it focused a bit heavily on the great distinction of these journals , the rest of this issue was informative and relatively modest . <p> When Fall 1984 arrived , I was gratified by the long lead article on the great Carlyle Letters project . This undertaking , begun by C. R. Sanders in the sixties , is a genuinely important work of literary scholarship -- arguably the finest ever done at Duke . A lengthy piece followed , however , on a new department member , Prof. Frank Lentricchia , who seemed an odd choice for Duke . He was himself a 1966 Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon in my time . Furthermore , his recent work had focused on highly theoretical , contemporary , political , and rather narrowly professional subjects . After the New Criticism ( 1980 ) , his most notable book , achieved great success due , I suspect , to the hope of many bewildered scholars that it would help them make sense of the opaque , jargon-ridden wastes of " contemporary theory . " At one point , Prof. Lentricchia tossed a crumb in the direction of Duke 's past commitment to historical literary scholarship , but it was clear to anyone familiar with his work that his loyalties lay elsewhere and that a department comprised of Lentricchia and others like him would be unlikely to produce another Carlyle Letters project . Indeed , his appearance on the scene strongly suggested that an idea of scholarship was beginning to obtain that was less catholic , literary , balanced , and disinterested than I had known . <p> My suspicions were increased by another piece on the new undergraduate English major , which , it was said , would now concentrate on " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A student " interested primarily in the history of the novel " could now mainly take courses related to that interest ; requirements based on historical , literary " periods " would be largely scrapped . Lest readers consider this approach flimsy , ahistorical , overly specialized , or irresponsible , the Newsletter assured us that students were required to take a course on a major author ( Chaucer , Shakespeare , or Milton ) . How one course on Milton would make much sense to an undergraduate largely read in the " history of the novel " the Newsletter did not indicate . My fears about the Duke of 1984 crystallized when the piece concluded with the following example of English prose : " As students recognize the excellence of an English major to later experience , both personal and professional , we hope to see increased interest in our courses continue . " It was a use of " excellence " with which I was unfamiliar . <p> The Spring 1985 Newsletter , on first blush , brought little bad news . But , in the midst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. Eliot , and Robert Penn Warren , there was an incoherent and largely incomprehensible piece by Prof. Gerald Monsman on his application of Derrida 's " deconstructive possibilities " to Walter Pater and ( of all people ) Charles Lamb : <p> I pointed out that for Pater ... there is no privileged source of meaning within the text -- not the author 's life , not the fate of his characters , not the text 's intellectual precursors , not the increments appended to it by the reader-critic -- but rather , that each component generates alternative possibilities of meaning because the imagery of the text contains within itself multiple , contradictory echoes . <p> This passage left me with three reflections : first , that this might -- given de-constructionist assumptions -- be applied to any writer ; second , that Prof. Monsman 's prose had benefited little from his study of Pater ; and , third , that this was a rather ominous straw in the wind regarding the English department . <p> I was at least right about the third reflection . In further reading , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced by a fragmented , " **29;54;TOOLONG " affair involving seven different courses , each doing its " own thing , " taught by faculty from every manner of department , and presided over by a resident " composition theorist . " The crowning touch was that each freshman would choose which course best suited him . <p> This latest revelation regarding program " reform " brought everything into focus . Whether freshman , senior major , or Ph.D . candidate , each student was to do whatever was right in his own eyes . Any concept of common expectations , experience , and bodies of knowledge , as well as a meaningful core curriculum , was clearly becoming a rare bird at Duke . It then dawned on me that without all these , not only students , but professors also would be blissfully free to pursue merely their own specialized interests . This insight would prove useful in " deconstructing " later newsletters . <p> Looking back I see that the first four issues were merely preparatory . Their self-congratulation , self-advertisement , general complacency , justification of questionable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were prelude to the grand announcement in the Fall 1985 issue that Stanley Fish was coming to Duke , as was his wife and fellow theorist Jane Tompkins . It was also noted , though rather parenthetically , that Fredric Jameson , America 's " foremost Marxist critic , " would soon grace the halls of Duke . <p> Clearly , something big was afoot . We had been told that the emperor was being fitted for a set of magnificent new clothes , and now the attendants were arriving with the complete line . Just what Prof. Fish 's impending presence signified was evident : <p> In accord with his resistance to orthodoxies and impetus to change , Fish feels that the greatest excitement in literary studies today is in feminist studies because of the " unwillingness to stop at any boundary real and imagined . " He notes that the " revisionary energy " of literary studies currently rests in feminist studies . <p> Prof. Tompkins , in an accompanying piece , described her view of literature as " a form of political power , " her " suspiciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary works that do " social work . " She indicated that as a " populist and feminist critic " she " likes to say that ' the road from Uncle Tom 's Cabin leads to The Valley of the Dolls . ' " Even to a reader of limited insight , it was evident that Prof. Lentricchia and Prof. Monsman were but humble John-the-Baptists to the true prophets . Those prophets had now arrived -- and with a new gospel . <p> The precise nature of that gospel became brilliantly clear in succeeding issues . Anything concerning traditional literary study , literary history , " the canon " -- literature per se -- was out , or at least deeply suspect . Contemporary " theory , " postmodernism , " pop culture , " " political approaches , " " gay studies , " " feminist studies , " and " the New Historicism " ( with its Marxist assumptions ) were the " new Duke . " Despite the seeming diversity of these approaches , their essential sameness was quickly revealed in the newsletter -- though such revelations could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory . " When , for instance , Prof. Fish was quoted in the Fall 1988 issue as saying : " Once you have subtracted from the accidents of class , race , gender , and political circumstance , what is it that you have left ? " it was perfectly in character . <p> The sorts of preoccupations and limitations implicit in Prof. Fish 's question quickly came to shape almost everything in the department , and this was mirrored in the Newsletter . Thus in the Spring 1986 issue , it was announced that " nonperiod specialization " would be the new emphasis at Duke . Such shifts in focus require new faculty , bringing to Duke Marianna Torgorvnick , a " cultural critic " and Jane Gaines , a " media critic . " The piece on Prof. Gaines was particularly interesting . At one point , she indulged in the sort of logic becoming quite common at Duke : " I have argued that film studies belongs in English departments because this strange presence ... better answers ... the question , ' What is literature ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a close study of those texts which are not considered literature . " Maintaining that people in " film and television studies ... must find every manifestation of mass culture significant , " she went on to assure the reader that such scholarship is quite respectable : " Now Duke can move ahead with assurance because media studies has established its theoretical pedigree . Academic study of film and television is respectably aligned with the most sophisticated French theories . " No doubt . <p> The Fall 1986 newsletter heralded the hiring of another " couple " : Professors Annabel and Lee Patterson were the result of " another impressive year of recruiting . " It was made clear that the Pattersons were linked not only in marriage , but also in their " commitment " to the " political " study of literature . Annabel Patterson specifically affiliated herself with the " reaction against the reaction against political history . " Readers would perhaps have liked to ask whose political history , but that would be frowned upon , and besides , we are all expected to know the answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new Duke . The first was a lecture by Prof. Fish on the " irrelevance of theory for practice in sports , literary studies , and the profession of judging . Examples came from legal texts , newspaper articles , and the career of former Baltimore Oriole pitcher Dennis Martinez . " The second ( not totally unrelated , perhaps ) involved the graduate English program : no longer were specific requirements needed to ensure the coverage of historical periods of literature , and comprehensive examinations would cease to be comprehensive and , instead , focus on " a major area . " Further , the foreign language requirement would also be closely tied to the " major area . " It occurred tome that with every reiterated claim of greater diversity and range at Duke , the actual literary and linguistic horizons of its students seemed to narrow . <p> The next three newsletters focused on continued hiring and the kind of " scholarly " activity characteristic of the new Duke . The Fall 1987 issue announced the acquisition of Barbara Herrnstein Smith , who apologized for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of herself as " always having been a theorist . " Prof. Smith 's major contribution to " theory " is that all values are " radically contingent . " Also noted was the arrival of some younger academics , including Regina Schwartz , who combined study of the Bible with ( what else ? ) contemporary theory , Michael Moses , whose main concerns were South American fiction and literary studies " within the context of political philosophy , " and Michael Moon , who combined the " New Historicism " and " gay studies . " I then read of John Clum 's several essays on homosexuality , Leigh Deneef 's deconstruction of Thomas Traherne , and Joseph Porter 's explorations of " postfeminist tragedy " in Shakespeare . The highlight of the issue , however , was its list of " visiting professors , " among them a Marxist , a feminist , and " a television theorist with a special interest in soap opera . " <p> Spring 1988 stands out for its coy protest that , despite recent " newspaper accounts , " the English department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Furthermore , it was asserted that the " classics are taught and abundantly , " offering as proof the fact that English majors were required to take a course on either Shakespeare , Chaucer , or Milton . What more could one ask ? <p> What really gets taught at Duke was perhaps more candidly revealed in the Fall 1988 issue . New hires were again noted , and the stars featured were Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick , who was quoted as observing that " if the work does n't have a strong political thrust , I do n't see how it matters . " Such a charge can hardly be leveled against her . Her work centers on " male sexuality , " " central oppressions " in our culture , and " the AIDS epidemic . " What literature Prof. Sedgwick addresses in this worthy scholarship was not revealed , though the 1989-90 newsletter published the titles of two of her papers : " How to Bring Your Kids Up Gay " and " Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl . " Apparently the classics are not dead at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose interests include " contemporary , marginal literatures . " Despite his brave commitment to the contemporary , he lamented his students ' lack of historical perspective : " The literature of the 60 's and 70 's is ancient history . These are people who first came to social awareness in 1980 if not 1984 . " Compensations , however , do exist for Prof. Ferraro . He is delighted to be in a department , he noted , in which The Godfather is deemed a masterpiece . <p> The latest newsletter ( 1989-90 ) continues to tell the good news about hiring , and we read that Duke has a new star in black studies , two new feminist theorists , and -- my favorite -- a specialist in " daily life . " This learned person is particularly interested in the scholarly contemplation of " aerobics , shopping malls , Barbie dolls , Michael Jackson , and Mickey Mouse . " I do n't know that we should be very surprised that the department 's new Mickey Mouse authority comes to Duke after an appointment in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California at Santa Cruz . <p> As tempting as it is to close on this sublime bit of bathos , I really can not do so , for despite its rich comic value , the " new English " at Duke is not finally funny . If $100,000-a-year professors at one of America 's most expensive and " elitist " schools want to posture as good comrades , populists , and the vanguard of class struggle , probably no lasting harm is done -- to them . There are undoubtedly , however , students at Duke who would like to study literature . What they are actually studying is made all too clear in two of the most recent Newsletters . It is noted that Duke graduate students have given a number of papers lately . And what are we to suppose were their topics ? Some tides are indicative : " From Screwballs to Cheeseballs : Comic Narrative and Ideology from Frank Capra to Rob Reiner , " " Fear and Loathing in the Literary Canon . " " The Gynecology of the Closet in The Changeling , " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Gender Paradigm , " and " Kierkegaard , Marxism , and Post-structuralism . " <p> This list is to me inexpressibly sad . Not only is the dreary sameness of the assumptions and preoccupations depressing , but completely or almost completely absent is any sign that the authors of these " works " have had any real exposure to the rich , beautiful , endlessly fascinating , and genuinely " liberating " fullness ( " canonical " and " noncanonical " ) of English and American literature from Anglo-Saxon times to our own . In the final analysis , it is not so much what the Duke English department actually does that matters -- as silly as much of it is -- rather , it is their painful and ultimately absurd desertion of literature as a great human art , and as a great instrument of culture in the Arnoldian sense , that condemns them . <p> By Phillip B.

##4000352 Section : POINT OF VIEW <p> Should the curriculum include more humanities ? Many thoughtful people think so . They argue that the humanities are needed to help us get back in touch with our essential humanity , regain our moral insight , recover our sense of values , return to our cultural roots , and restore our political traditions. 1 Like the humanities themselves , this argument is inspirational but vague ; and because it is vague , it is dangerous . It leaves many questions unanswered , and this leaves room for people to answer these questions in ways we might not like . <p> Here are some of the questions that need answering . What , exactly , are the " humanities " ? Which courses in humanities will students be required to take ? Why should these courses be preferred to those they will replace ? Who will teach these courses , and whose humanity , moral insight , values , culture , and tradition will they advance ? How will these courses be taught ? I believe that these and similar questions must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether requiring more humanities is a good idea or a bad one . The Vagueness of the Idea of the Humanities <p> If anything can safely be said about this subject , it is that the term humanities is not well defined . Consider the list of courses that will satisfy the humanities requirement in my own university 's so-called core curriculum. 2 This list , which is typical , contains just under a hundred items and is still growing . In addition to the usual courses in literature , classics , history , anthropology , philosophy , and religion , there are also courses in art , music ( both jazz and classical ) , dance , American studies , women 's studies , Latin American studies , communications , political science , speech , film , etc . This is a very heterogeneous and divergent lot . These courses may have what the philosopher Wittgenstein called family resemblance , meaning that A has eyes like B , who has a nose like C , but there is almost certainly no way in which they all resemble each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , but that it is too diffuse . No one could object to the richness of choice if it served a clear and coherent educational purpose , but , if it does , who can say what that is ? Certainly not I. Each of these courses may have its value , but the value is different in each case . There does not seem to be anything that all of them have in common . So , there does not seem to be any reason to group them all together and require every student to take one or more . <p> It is sometimes said that the humanities all have in common a concern with values . Accordingly , courses in art and literature treat of things that embody aesthetic values , and courses in feminism or Marxism treat of economic , political , and moral values . Yes , but every human activity , including science and engineering , either treats of or embodies values . Thus , the social sciences treat of values in discussing human behavior , and the physical sciences embody values by preferring evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exclusive possession of the humanities . <p> We could , of course , try to limit the humanities to particular sorts of values . For example , we could try limiting them to aesthetic values . The humanities would then include nothing but courses in art , music , and literature . Women 's studies and communications would be left out . Yes , but also left out would be the first two parts of Northrop Frye 's famous triad of humanities : philosophy , history , and literature . Why not then simply limit the humanities to Frye 's triad ? Because that would leave nothing out . Philosophy , history , and literature are universal media ; they cover everything . So , once you 've included them , you 've included everything else , too . <p> We could leave out the arts if we limited the humanities to moral values , but we would then have to include women 's studies , black studies , economics , politics , and so on . In fact , social science would now comprise most of the humanities -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desires . <p> Evidently , it is hard to find a characterization of " the humanities " that will limit them to a short and well-defined list of things . In fact , every choice is arbitrary . Although no single principle , rule , or definition determines what counts among " the humanities , " there is a perfectly good explanation and justification for every item on virtually everybody 's list . Humanities Has Added New Meaning with Each Age <p> Why this is so will become evident after we review the history of the concept of the humanities . As this history reveals , the word humanities is a chameleon which has changed its color to suit every age and ideology . In consequence , it has not one well-defined meaning but many different , if overlapping , meanings . <p> So far as I have been able to discover , the idea of the humanities originated in the Renaissance , when scholars tired of medieval theology and other-worldliness distinguished literae humaniores , writings about things human in scale , from literae divinae , writing about things divine in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been given over to God and the church , most of the down-to-earth writings were in classical Latin or Greek . Therefore , the first humanists were classicists , lovers and scholars of classical literature . More generally , they were admirers of things classical , devotees of classical ( i.e. , Greek and Roman ) literature , art , and culture . <p> Present use of the term humanities still retains some of its original meaning ; but the term has also acquired a very different connotation , one that is in some ways broader , in other ways narrower . <p> First , the broader connotation . Where medieval theology had been dry and logical , the classics were elegant and charming . So , the adjective humanistic soon came to connote not just the subject but also the style of the writing . In fact , style eventually counted for more that content . Whether the writing was about man or God ceased to matter very much ; what mattered was whether it was refined or florid . Hence , humanities now more often denotes what the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything at all , human or divine . <p> Once this extension of usage came into existence , a still further extension was soon to follow . If what made literature humanistic was its refinement or elegance , then the same could be said of all art , whether literary or not . Accordingly , humanities has come to denote not just poems and stories but all refined art , including painting , music , sculpture , film , and the like . As a result , humanistic now means arty -- in other words , refined , cultivated , and effete . <p> This broadening of the term to include all of the refined arts has been accompanied by a compensating narrowing . In the Renaissance , humanists prized classical discussions of science . One of the greatest discoveries of humanist scholars was a copy of Lucretius ' poem On the Nature of Things , which made known to modem scientists the atomic theory of matter first formulated by Democritus of classical Greece . Also of interest to Renaissance humanists were Roman writings on engineering , governmental administration , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adopt the factual , analytical manner of the medieval scholastics , science and technology ceased to count as humanistic . In fact , both science and its technological applications came to be regarded as the embodiment of all things that were not humanistic . C. P. Snow 's " two cultures " came into being , as science became antihumanistic and humanists became antiscientific . <p> The exclusion of things scientific was completed in the nineteenth century , when the German romantics distinguished what they called Geistewissenschaffen , studies of the spirit , from what they called Naturwissenschaffen , studies of the physical world. 4 Believing that a human being is essentially a spiritual , not a physical , being , the Germans reinterpreted the humanities as inspirational studies , the main purpose of which was to influence not the intellect but the will and the emotions . This made theology , which had originally been the very opposite of a humanistic study , into the most important such study . It also meant that science was now formally excluded from the humanities by virtue of its content as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had flowed from science . Accordingly , humanistic now meant things ornamental , inspirational , and cultivated but unscientific and impractical. 5 <p> In summary , the word humanities originally meant the naturalistic writings , then the naturalistic art , of classical Greece and Rome . Later , it signified any form of refined art or writing , and then any form of art or writing that is edifying , inspirational , or entertaining but not analytical , informative , or utilitarian . At one time or another , therefore , humanities has denoted just about anything anybody cares to mention . <p> Given this history , it is no wonder that lists of " the humanities " are so lengthy and diffuse . One might desire to prune these lists , but there is no obvious and principled way to do it . In the history of the term humanities one can find a justification for every item on the list . So , whether he likes it or not , a friend of " the humanities " is committed to them all . The Diverse Values of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diffuse and divergent collection of things ? The customary answer is , again , one that mentions " values . " We teach the humanities , it is said , in order to teach our pupils a sense of aesthetic , moral , political , economic , or intellectual values . Let us now examine this answer . <p> Obviously , it owes a lot to the romantic conception of the humanities . In that conception , the humanities are inspirational rather than scientific studies ; their main function , as the romantics themselves emphasized , is to cultivate not the intellect but the passions and the will . In other words , their business is to inculcate us with certain moral and aesthetic values . Where the sciences teach facts and logic , the humanities are to teach feelings , obligations , and taste . Where the sciences teach us how the world is , the humanities teach us what it ought to be . Where the sciences endeavor to understand the world , the humanities aspire to take the right attitude towards it and make efforts to improve it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea is questionable because it leaves out the social sciences , which deal with both facts and values , and overlooks the fact that natural science embodies and teaches the values inherent in a preference for reason and truth . However , let us overlook these difficulties . For the sake of the discussion , let us grant the distinction . How does it help ? <p> So far as I can see , it does not . Here is why : once the topic of values has been raised , we inevitably face the question , " Whose values ? Mine or yours ? " You like Mozart ; I like Monk . Who will we teach our students to like ? You prefer Matisse : I prefer Grandma Moses . Who will we teach our students to prefer ? Jones favors feminism , Smith , a strong family . Which will we teach our students to favor ? Sarah believes in free enterprise , Sam , in socialist equality . Which will we teach our students to believe in ? <p> To some people , the answer will seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prefer what is beautiful to what is ugly , what is good to what is bad , what is true to what is false , and so on . Unfortunately , these abstract terms -- truth , beauty , justice , goodness , etc. -- conceal great intellectual and practical problems . Who gets to decide what is to count as true , beautiful , just , or good ? You , I , or somebody else ? <p> This is no problem where you and I , who share essentially the same values , are designing a curriculum for a private school or university supported by voluntary contributions and attended by people who wish to be taught what we wish to teach them . Designing a curriculum for a public school or university , however , presents a moral difficulty . This arises from the fact that it is contrary to the principles of a free society to compel citizens to pay taxes to support the teaching of values that can not be reconciled with their own consciences and interests ; and it is doubly onerous to compel them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The public schools are nobody 's private property . They do not belong to any group to do with as it pleases . Rather , they are the property of all who must pay the taxes that support them or submit their children to their tutelage . What Are Our Choices ? <p> What then should we do ? The answer , I think , lies in giving up the idea of using the schools to teach students " values " per se , and insisting instead that they be taught skills . In particular , we can insist they be taught the intellectual skills that used to be known as the liberal arts . I believe that , in the process of learning these valuable skills , students will also automatically acquire some of the most important values , namely , respect for discipline , hard work , reason , truth , honesty , excellence , achievement , civility , etc . There will be no need or room for indoctrination . <p> These remarks will puzzle some readers . It is generally believed that the humanities and the liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , it will seem inconsistent to praise the one while condemning the other . It is also widely believed that the main business of teaching the humanities is to refine the tastes and improve the morality and politics of our pupils . So , it will seem self-contradictory to reject doing this while recommending training for citizenship . How the Liberal Arts Differ from the Humanities <p> To resolve these paradoxes , I must now explain how the liberal arts differ from the humanities and why teaching the skills necessary for good citizenship can escape the temptation to engage in political or moral indoctrination . <p> The idea of the liberal arts was invented by the ancient Romans , to whom the word arts meant " skills " and the word liberal signified " free . " Accordingly , the great Roman writers Cicero and Seneca explained that the liberal arts were the intellectual skills needed by free men -- as opposed to the menial skills needed by slaves . Among the liberal arts as thus understood were the skills of calculating , reasoning , reading , writing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility and prerogative , as citizens , to participate in making or approving policy for the republic . In short , the liberal arts were the skills needed for free and effective citizenship . <p> The term liberal arts retained this rich and complex meaning throughout the Middle Ages . In the typical medieval university , the basic studies were the seven artes liberales , which comprised the trivium of logic , grammar , and rhetoric and the quadrivium of arithmetic , geometry , astronomy , and music ( i.e. , poetry ) . Higher education involved the study of more esoteric subjects : revealed philosophy ( i.e. , theology ) , natural philosophy ( i.e. , science ) , and moral philosophy ( i.e. , ethics ) . Anyone who went through this curriculum got a liberal education , one fitting him not to earn a living or enrich himself at a particular occupation , but to fulfill his public responsibilities as a citizen . He could read , write , and reason at a very high level of proficiency . <p> It should now be clear that the liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the concept of the liberal arts is far better defined . Second , the liberal arts are skills whereas the humanities are subjects . Third , mathematics is one of the most important of the liberal arts , but it is positively excluded by the romantic conception of the humanities . Fourth , although they are intellectual rather than occupational skills , the liberal arts are useful rather than ornamental , utilitarian rather than inspirational ; unlike the humanities as they are presently conceived , the liberal arts can not be equated with the refined arts . Finally , there is no antagonism between the liberal arts and either science or technology . Teaching the Liberal Arts Should Be Our First Priority <p> My contention , broadly stated , is that we ought to concern ourselves first with instruction in the liberal arts . We should make the teaching of the subjects embodied in the humanities , and in the social or natural sciences , a goal of secondary importance to the inculcation of intellectual skill . <p> The reasons are obvious . Everybody needs these skills , but few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own experience as a college teacher confirms , students these days can not read or write or calculate , much less reason effectively . I know from personal experience that we are now graduating with B.A. and B.S. degrees people who can not write grammatical sentences , read and understand paragraphs , calculate simple percentages , or compose a coherently formulated argument -- things many eighth graders could do fifty years ago . This is shocking , it is shameful , and it desperately needs to be corrected . <p> But we are not going to correct it if we continue to fight over whose values to teach . Instead , we shall just distract attention from what truly and most urgently needs to be done , namely , restoring to our students the capacity to reason seriously . <p> The task may seem insuperable , but if we attempt it we have one thing going for us : it is , in fact , an objective that virtually everybody , whatever his political or religious convictions , can support -- because virtually everyone will benefit from its realization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arts -- as much of them as we can get . So , anybody with any sense wants to be able to read and write at as high a level of proficiency as his abilities will allow . <p> For this reason alone , instruction in the liberal arts ought to be one of the main tasks of public education in a free society . Training people in the refined arts ought to come second . So should training in the occupational or vocational arts , as well as training in moral , religious , and political values . <p> Please note that nothing in this proposal either rules out teaching the humanities , the social sciences , or any other subject or denigrates the importance of exposing students to rival values and views of life . It just requires that these be taught with an eye to increasing the student 's level of literacy , numeracy , and general powers of reason . What better way to teach students to read and think than by doing it through Plato , the Bible , Shakespeare , Jefferson , Marx , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take courses which are aimed at influencing their attitudes and conduct , but not at raising their level of intellectual skill . <p> Unfortunately , humanities courses do not always satisfy this standard . In a passionate and eloquent essay on the topic , writer and former teacher Ellen Ashdown has pointed out that many humanities courses in the public junior colleges are designed not to raise the level of student literacy but to accommodate the illiterate student. 7 Such courses use books with lots of pictures in them , and rather than teaching the student to read or write they rub a little high culture off on him while collecting his fees . <p> The universities have little cause to feel superior . To see why not , consider English and history , the two most popular fields in the humanities . When taught correctly , they are excellent vehicles for inculcating the liberal arts ; but they are not always taught in the right way . Teaching the liberal arts is labor-intensive ; it takes time. 8 Professors in the public universities have far too many students to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , as William Arrowsmith pointed out long ago , the professors of English generally leave the teaching of literacy to their graduate students , to whom they teach literature. 9 The professors of history do something similar . They teach great masses of students names and dates in mind-numbing survey courses while graduate students mark the papers . This is not the fault of the professors , who are often doing as best they can under difficult circumstances ; but it nonetheless needs to be corrected . Until it is corrected , we can not automatically expect students to learn the liberal arts from studying English and history . Conclusion <p> The moral of the story is this : an argument can be made for requiring students ( especially in the public schools ) to study courses -- whether in the humanities or not -- when these are taught with a eye to inculcating the liberal arts , the basic intellectual skills that every citizen requires . Little argument can be made , however , for increased study of the humanities where this will have the result of substituting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basic skills of the intellect ; and no argument at all in support of using the humanities to indoctrinate students in the moral , religious , or political values of any group . <p> It will be objected that teaching people to read , write , calculate , and reason is the business of the grammar and the high schools ; and so it is . But I believe that the colleges and universities should also teach these skills , albeit at a higher level . Furthermore , the debate over which level should do it is academic . At the moment , neither the grade schools nor the institutions of higher education are teaching the liberal arts . They must both go back to doing so . For reasons that the ancient Romans understood well but we have somehow managed to forget , our preservation as a republic of free citizens may depend on it . <p> This brings us back to politics . As these last remarks suggest , the purpose of teaching the liberal arts is political ; but it is political in the broadest and best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competency in the liberal arts is good for the whole political order and everybody in it . Emphasizing the primacy of the liberal arts is , however , certainly not political in the narrow and bad but popular sense of that word : the liberal arts are not partisan ; they do n't favor the program of this political party over that one ; they do n't advance one group 's interests at the expense of another 's . Rather , possessing the liberal arts enables every group to advance its own interests and , thereby , the well-being of the whole . <p> 
##4000357 On 5 April 1990 , the New York Times reported that Dr. Joel Segall , president of Baruch College of the City University of New York , was resigning from his job , following a critical review by the Middle States Association of Schools and Colleges . There was no allegation that Baruch was anything less than an excellent college . In fact , it is widely regarded as one of the four top business colleges in the country and trains almost one out of every three of the certified public accountants working in New York . Rather , the complaint was that there were not enough " minorities " in the faculty and administration and that not enough " minorities " graduated . Disturbing though this is , even more unsettling is the fact that the criticism was concocted by the central offices of the accrediting agency , acting independently of its own guidelines and evaluation team . <p> While it contained some criticisms of Baruch 's curriculum , the public report issued by the evaluation team itself was on the whole quite positive . ( The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioning ethnic tensions and the lack of minorities on the faculty . The report did not state that accreditation was to be withheld or deferred because of these matters . ) According to procedure commonly followed in accreditation , Baruch was given an opportunity to submit a statement answering the criticisms in the team 's report . Following the college 's response , a still confidential letter from Sarah Blandshei , the chair of the Middle States Association , is said to have indicated that accreditation would be " deferred " because of the " minority " attrition rate and the lack of " minorities " in the administration and faculty . <p> Dr. Howard L. Simmons , executive director of the Middle States Association , acknowledges that under his leadership , the agency has undertaken a new activist role . He has asserted , according to a recent issue of Black Issues in Higher Education , that all universities must be made responsible for the success of " minorities " in higher education. 1 In order to do this , Simmons said in an interview , the faculty and administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the student body . " 2 This is part of a broad initiative by Simmons . According to published reports , fifteen to twenty other institutions have also been threatened on these grounds by the association ; Baruch 's is only the first case to become public . <p> The attack on Segall and the Baruch faculty represents an ominous direction taken by accreditation . For the first time , an accrediting agency is criticizing the ethnic composition of a college 's graduating class , as well as making specific complaints about the racial makeup of its faculty and staff . According to a source on the Department of Education 's National Advisory Committee on Accreditation and Institutional Eligibility , such a step is entirely unprecedented . No other accrediting agency has ever undertaken an aggressive role in attempting to impose racial quotas on faculty , administrators , and graduates . <p> In itself , the attempt to control the ethnicity of university personnel is nothing new . In the last twenty years , the concept of affirmative action has evolved into a quota system in which white males are routinely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article in the American Scholar. 3 Although deeply threatening to the integrity of the university because they undermine the concept of professional peer review , quotas imposed on personnel committees have been a long time aborning , and it does not appear that they will be easily abolished . Until recently , however , the federal government was the principal agency in this coercion . Now , it appears , the effort has shifted from government to private agencies such as Middle States , accompanied by the notion that henceforth a college may have its accreditation withheld if it does not graduate the right percentages of certain ethnic groups . A Racial Graduation Quota ? <p> When asked if a college could be found delinquent for failing to graduate sufficient numbers of " minority " students , Simmons agreed that Middle States does use an " outcomes-based approach " for granting or withholding its approval . He denied that Middle States has any " hard and fast rules " regarding minority retention rates , indicating there is " never a single standard " in assessing a school 's performance in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Characteristics of Excellence in Higher Education : Standards for Accreditation , the handbook used by Middle States . In fact , there is no statement whatsoever in that manual concerning minority retention rates . When this was pointed out , Simmons changed his mind and said that accreditation is granted or withheld on a case-by-case basis . " I know that sounds hard to understand , " he admitted , " but that 's how they do it . The team decides differently for each school . " There are " so many factors involved " that there can be " no quantitative standards " for evaluating a college . So much for the objective criteria of accreditation . <p> What is particularly bizarre about Simmon 's line of reasoning is the fact that students at Baruch , regardless of racial and ethnic identity , generally have a much better chance of graduating than elsewhere . Of white freshmen at Baruch , 48 percent graduate in four years , compared to a national average of 40 percent ; 37 percent of black freshman graduate in four years , compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduate in four years , compared to 42 percent nationwide. 4 ( Only " Hispanics , " a particularly heterogeneous group whose actual composition varies greatly by region , do slightly less well -- 31 percent at Baruch and 35 percent nationwide . ) <p> Apparently , not only have the criteria for " minority retention " been invented for the occasion by Middle States headquarters , but the true numbers have been ignored . It is likely that the criteria are kept deliberately vague in order to increase the arbitrary power of the accreditors . The use of an unstated but de facto racial graduation quota puts university administrators in a vulnerable position , since there is no way to tell whether Middle States will charge them with not having satisfied the goal of graduating sufficient numbers of designated minority groups . The lack of precision permits Middle States to deny that they are seeking any exact outcome , thereby avoiding legal action . At the same time , when it suits them they can use the " outcomes-based approach " as a potential threat to colleges seeking accreditation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real racial graduation quota , residents and deans will be inclined to design programs to increase graduation prospects for protected groups . <p> Middle States can thus obtain the desired outcome without ever having to invoke the threat explicitly , and all the while remain protected from public scrutiny . Simmons admits having adopted the same tactic with many other institutions , but because of the secrecy involved in the accreditation process , he has not had to be held publicly accountable . However , in this he may have violated federal regulations . The Department of Education has criteria for recognition of accrediting agencies , one being that an agency " not mislead the public " regarding an " institution 's or program 's educational effectiveness . " 5 Can Whites Teach Blacks , and Vice Versa ? <p> The other criticism leveled against Baruch is that is does not employ enough " minorities . " In reality , this argument is absurd , since many Baruch professors are Jewish and non-white Asians . But in education-speak , such individuals are not defined as " minorities . " Middle States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-Hispanic whites and not enough blacks for a student body that includes many blacks and Hispanics . Thus , the broader question at issue is whether or not white instructors can adequately teach " minority " students . The " diversity " of a student body , according to Middle States , must be matched by a corresponding " diversity " of faculty and administrators . This belief is so widespread amongst academic administrative cognoscenti that few question it . When the logic of such a concept is challenged , the usual response is that a white professor can not be as good a " role model " for a black student as a black professor . <p> In fact , there is little or no systematic evidence for this argument . In social psychology , the notion of " role model " is correctly applied to the basic socialization of children , when explaining how in childhood we " identify " with others , particularly parents , siblings , and peers , and choose certain persons ( particularly those of the same sex ) on whom to model ourselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be as likely to " de-identify " or want to be the opposite of a peer or a sibling or a parent . It is also highly questionable whether this process takes place after puberty . At most , therefore , while one may suggest that professors can serve as inspirational mentors to college students , no evidence exists that such individuals must be of the same sex , race , or cultural background . The idea of " role model , " in short , is fraudulently applied in the field of higher education . <p> Indeed , if such a concept did make sense , it would have exactly the opposite results of what Middle States ostensibly desires . It would mean not only that black students should be counseled to take courses only from black professors , but also that white students should not take courses from black professors . If black students need black professors as role models to spur them to greater levels of achievement , white students require and deserve the same kind of encouragement . Taken to its logical conclusion , the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racial segregation in higher education . If black students respond best to black professors , they ought to maximize their chances by enrolling at all-black colleges . The same would apply , mutatis mutandis , to white students . <p> Another justification for the use of racial quotas in hiring is the suggestion that white professors are somehow harder on black students . As closet , or unconscious , racists , white faculty are , according to this argument , responsible for the higher dropout rate of blacks . In point of fact , there is no evidence for greater white professorial bias against black students . Dr. June O'Neill , a former member of the United States Commission on Civil Rights and professor at Baruch 's Center for Business and Government , has done extensive research on the determinants of black and white high school students ' achievements when they are young adults . Black students who have black teachers tend to do less well in terms of verbal aptitude , but this is because black faculty tend to be less well prepared . By itself , a teacher 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is doubtful , however , that Simmons and his allies are inspired by evidence or logic . There is no reason to believe that much reflection was done on the scientific basis for their criticisms and suggestions . Rather than call for measures that will actually improve the quality of education at the institutions they investigate , they seek symbolic moves that produce positive media images . Future Implications of Accreditation Quotas <p> In the classic accreditation process , institutions are evaluated on the basis of the stringency or laxity of their educational standards . In the past , if a college was found to be too lax , accreditation was withheld , or perhaps conditionally granted pending correction of certain deficiencies . But now , for the first time , a college 's accreditation has been " deferred , " not because its standards are too low , but because they are too high . An institution of higher learning is being directed to arrange its faculty , administration , and curriculum so that a de facto racial graduation quota can be filled . Aside from some serious issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abolition of institutional autonomy and faculty control over the hiring process . <p> It is no coincidence that this new and arbitrary direction has been taken by a private accrediting agency . In 1989 the Supreme Court issued a series of decisions that seriously undermined the ability of government to require institutions to use racial and sexual quotas in hiring and promotions . Though this was a serious setback for those who would like to see a political system governed by racial and sexual entitlement , they have evidently regrouped . <p> For example , under the sponsorship of Senators Kennedy and Hawkins , the Civil Rights Bill of 1990 currently being argued in Congress would reimpose on employers the burden of proving that they did not discriminate against minorities in hiring . Since it is virtually impossible to prove that something has not occured , the result will be that employers ( including colleges and universities ) will be obliged to adopt quotas in hiring in order to forestall potential lawsuits . This is particularly likely because the same legislation will require employers to pay the cost of employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discrimination free of charge . <p> On the level of academic rhetoric , the tactic has been to substitute " diversity " for the now-tainted " affirmative action , " since it is widely recognized that the latter has produced discriminatory preferential hiring . Surveys show that most blacks , as well as most whites , are opposed to preferential treatment for blacks . Using " diversity " sounds better because the term is vague and it is hard to say one is against it . But the Baruch case shows what " diversity " truly means ; it is simply old wine in new bottles . <p> That there is no logical or empirical justification for racial quotas in hiring or graduation should not need saying . But Simmons and his allies are not governed by logic or facts ; they are driven by a sense of moral righteousness that is impervious to any argument . Rather than conforming to consistent and objective standards of excellence , Simmons makes up the rules as he goes along . Rather than appealing to the intellect , Simmons tugs at people 's basest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education . <p> 
##4000358 Recently I read a fine article by Prof. Walter Berns , called " The Core as an Education for Natural Aristocrats " ( see Academic Questions , Summer 1989 ) . It 's a Jeffersonian idea and I agree with it , but for some reason I find that I spend much more time worrying about that oxymoron , the natural bourgeoisie , than about any kind of aristocracy , natural or conventional . <p> It 's true that students at liberal arts colleges , even in Ohio , have a kind of aristocratic assurance that their lives will be successful , and that they will do important things in the world . Also , they tend to enjoy something of the high-minded innocence of the well-reared and protected which encourages them to love learning for its own sake rather than for material utility . But , to belabor the obvious , above all they are creatures of liberal democracy and , as such , irredeemably bourgeois . They pretend to be relativists but are really believers in rights and individual responsibility . Underneath the high-toned moralism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lives they will lead when they graduate will overwhelmingly be bourgeois lives , composed of the usual professional and commercial careers , condominiums , divorces , therapies , and retirements . <p> Of course , not only do liberal educators know this , but on the whole it drives them wild . As we all know , by and large liberal arts professors belong to that strain of the bourgeoisie which dislikes itself ; hence the really powerful intellectual movements on contemporary campuses are all characterized by bourgeois-bashing . What holds " humanistic , " i.e. , aesthetic , Nietzschean Marxism together is hatred of the human products of commercial republics . Feminism , which in the larger society has strong elements that are irreproachably bourgeois ( wages , equality , self-fulfillment ) , in the prestigious universities is magnetized to utopian , antibourgeois speculations about overcoming the " tyranny " of gender or " patriarchy . " Deconstruction , despite , and indeed because of its air of a political cool , mocks the square epistemological naivete of workaday life . The crusade against the dominance of " Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students to something really exotic , and thus to destroy their bourgeois complacency . Pedagogical politics is thoroughly antibourgeois , whether it is engaged in purifying democracy of its bourgeois taint or creating idealists who are to work for a better nonbourgeois and perhaps nonliberal world . <p> Yet there is something paradoxical and self-defeating to the point of comedy in the way this all works out . To understand this , one has to remember why the bourgeois got such a bad reputation in the first place . This is not self-evident . In certain passages Adam Smith , for example , glorifies the honesty , straightforwardness and independence of the bourgeois . Where the courtly spaniel fawns and begs for a bone of patronage , the manly bourgeois plunks his hard-earned money down and " trucks " for his wherewithal . There are still some students like this , mostly economics majors , who simply can not be made to feel guilty about maximizing their utilities . Still , most of the students I see resemble the bourgeoisie Rousseau denounces and Moliere lampoons , a bourgeoisie intimidated by aristocratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bourgeois is a creature of cities , but not really a citizen , just a lover of private life , peace , and commerce . Alienated from his original human nature as a happy , sappy , witless beast , he has not achieved a coherent second nature . That is why " the natural bourgeoisie " is an oxymoron ; the bourgeois is convention incarnate . This makes him extremely nervous and he lives , like Moliere 's M. Jourdan , according to the opinions of others . His natural self-love sours into amour propre , poisoned by fears about his neighbors ' judgment of his lawn , his car , his politics , and his soul . The vice of vanity constitutes his inner life . He wants to be liked , even if not well-liked , if only someone will tell him what rules to conform to . In the end , most do not go as far as M. Jourdan ; most do not try to transform themselves utterly into aristocrats or -- as is more typical today -- proletarians or bohemians . But mostly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscience . <p> I find that students fit the pattern pretty well . The smugness which their teachers find so exasperating is only an attitude , struck for lack of a better , and easily gives way to self-contempt and cynicism . Last year I heard the actress Jody Foster , recently graduated from Yale , interviewed on a morning news show . The interviewer asked Ms. Foster if playing a rape victim in a film had enabled her to relive the real victim 's plight . Of course not , came the reply , to imagine that would just be " bourgeois . " I gather from this that Ms. Foster had learned her lessons well at Yale . She had learned that " bourgeois " is a synonym for philistine , fake , and vulgar . <p> But did learning this make her less bourgeois ? She may think so , but , to judge by the students I see , she would be wrong . Contempt for the bourgeoisie is in fact a classic and unattractive bourgeois trait that today 's liberal education tends merely to aggravate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently assumes the character of a pathological , " passive aggressive " relationship . On the surface , one parmer constantly exhorts , denounces , and edifies while the other heaps ashes on his head , confesses , and grovels . Really , however , the apparent victim , in this case the student , remains quite untouched , absorbs the critique into a preexisting pattern of self-blame and determination to resist , and often succeeds in revenging himself in typical passive aggressive ways by constantly offering hope of reform and constantly frustrating it . Real liberal education is thus twice blocked : first by the genuine , though hidden , resentment felt against what liberal education appears to be , and second by the students ' delusions that they have overcome their bourgeois limitations when they have merely intensified them . <p> Of course , the question Rousseau raises about the bourgeois is a version of the question we are treating here . There is indeed something defective about the bourgeois as a citizen , precisely because of his irony and anxiety , which are inextricably attached to his privatism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bourgeois wavers between gestures of " commitment " and gestures of cynicism , between bursts of indignant enthusiasm ( for drugs today , against them tomorrow ) and retreats into passivity . The middle position between these gestures which , knowing themselves as gestures , are also done in bad faith , is a moderation essentially helpless , unguided by principle . Argument can lead nowhere : Should we interfere with other governments ? No . What about South Africa ? That 's different . Should we protect freedom of speech ? Yes . What about racist speech ? Well ... <p> It seems to me that ever since Rousseau there has been a great emerging argument in the West about how to ennoble and edify the bourgeoisie . Humanist Marxists , socialist communitarians , teachers of republican virtue , and even , though secretly I think , the overtly unedifying literary critics are all engaged in the task . Of course , as Allan Bloom has reminded us , liberal education always must balance against the prejudices of the regime , partly for the sake of the regime but mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not understand itself as essentially or primarily edifying . <p> Yet it seems to me that under current circumstances the argument between thought for its own sake and for political and moral edification is largely moot . This is because , as far as I can tell , all efforts at edification are failures on their own terms precisely because they are sensed , however dimly , as efforts at edification rather than real education . The contemporary version of anti-bourgeois moralizing fails with particularly comic aplomb because it plays right into those bourgeois traits it seeks to overcome . But the more serious nineteenth-century version , which had its roots in German classicism 's project of aesthetic education , failed as well . <p> Unlike contemporary moralism , which conceals itself as open-mindedness , the nineteenth-century version sought to combat mean-spirited anxiety directly . By holding heroic examples to the bourgeois for inspection and emulation , the bourgeois was supposed to become nobler , his vulgar tastes refined , his self-regarding passions generously extended . <p> In Schiller 's Don Carlos , written years before he developed the theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice , we have the classic test case . The play 's apparent hero , the Marquis Posa , is a good eighteenth-century liberal set in despotic , unenlightened times . He is presented as both noble and democratic , a citizen of the world and a loving friend , a model to the high-minded young of the new , more egalitarian world . <p> But a careful reading of the play shows Posa to be a far more ambiguous character than his edifying appearance , a bad friend and an incompetent politician , motivated by vanity . The true greatness of the play depends on that more careful reading . Yet Schiller 's intent seems to have been to allow the edifying , moralizing reading to be generally accepted . The consequence was that the nobility of the example became unreal . Posa and other Schillerian heroes became hollow plaster casts of classical statuary which could be filled with any political content . Hence those horrible monographs one can still find in card catalogs on Schiller the Nationalist , Schiller the Socialist , Schiller the National Socialist . The ennobled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , understood it to be a gesture devoid of content . Hence , in part , the failure of high German culture to create a sufficiently responsible , politically decent bourgeoisie , a failure betokened in many old war movies by the figure of the sensitive , piano-playing German officer who still , justly , gets shot at the end . <p> The most edifying education that middle class Americans can receive , it seems to me , is the one that is the least overtly edifying , the least concerned to hector them or remake them , the one that is most concerned with setting out the matters of fact about themselves and the world . Trivial though this suggestion may appear , its implications may not be . <p> What would such an education look like ? It would share with the contemporary " diversity " movement the goal of letting students understand that their habitual customs and tastes are not simply natural but a product of prior choices that they must either affirm or reject . That means it would have to make available to them the Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Starting with a polemical animus against what the students presumably are , one teaches a wide variety of texts , taken out of the context of highly developed cultures , which are then made comprehensible by a hopelessly Western , if antibourgeois , analysis . The result is gesture and costume . Like those Nobel Hurons and Compassionate Pashas the eighteenth-century Enlightenment loved so dearly , the student sees the Other dressed in exotic garb , but he is really looking in the mirror and all he ever sees is himself . Thus he thinks he is learning " non-Western values , " when in fact it is only in a particular part of the West that faiths are thought of as " values . " Because he does not know himself he can not know the Other and thus can not know himself through the Other . Adding Fanon to the canon in no way rescues students from the grasp of Dead White European Males ; it merely adds a couple of outfits to the great historical fashion show to go with , say , the guitar of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The alternative would be to start with the West , not tormented by the bizarre dogma that everyone , from Aristotle to Augustine , was really just confirming the goodness of the American status quo . There students discover versions of the good , human types , which both distress and attract them : honor-loving warriors , contemplation-loving philosophers , God-fearing prophets and mystics , serious , warlike relativists , irrationalist scientists . They come to see for themselves what they are , what their lives are and generally will be like . As they reflect on their own responses to the arguments they are faced with , they come to understand the bourgeois not as a historical accident or , as Ms. Foster was taught , a social solecism , but as the product of a very serious choice that has its strengths and limitations . <p> On this basis , they can , if they are willing to expend the costs in time and energy , study a non-Western culture in a serious way , learning the language , taking its account of the good as seriously as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suspect it will be much easier in most cases to find the way to the samurai ideal from the Greek gentleman described by Aristotle than from the contemporary antibourgeois bourgeois prejudice which shudders at the very notion of rank , or to find the way to Asian religion from a serious study of Augustine than from the contemporary dogmas of those who understand religion only as a manifestation of " culture . " <p> On this basis , too , students can , I think , become better citizens of a liberal democracy . They learn how to escape from the plight of M. Jourdan , alternating helplessly between the attitudes of immense self-satisfaction and total anxiety . It is not that they are freed from irony about themselves . On the contrary , their irony will be far deeper because it will not have the phony salvation of progressive self-righteousness to offer it temporary and inadequate relief . They know much better than before just how far they are from what is truly excellent . But this knowledge , partly because it is knowledge , their knowledge , need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's own shortcomings is part of one 's life , one 's possession , and not a perpetual damnation by some unappeasable figure of authority . In those circumstances , it makes sense to try to change oneself from inside , to approximate standards that are not merely one 's own but which one has made one 's own , without regard to the opinions of others . <p> This is of course what those who sought to ennoble the bourgeoisie were after ; it is at the heart of the Kantian project that even now , in scientific disguise as Kohlbergian psychology , heavily influences the schools . But that end can not be held up as an ideal or hypostatized into a standard . If the end is already known , if we communicate , however subtly , that becoming more sensitive , or a more virtuous citizen , or a despiser of bourgeois vulgarity , or even an autonomous moral being is the goal of education , then that education degenerates into edification . Only if all the cards are put on the table can students , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hot gospeling are constitutive of their bourgeois lives , emerge from the crippling irony and anxieties that are at root the same thing , whether they express themselves as cynicism or dogmatism . Only then can students become what they are , which is a necessary step to becoming something better than they are as citizens , as human beings , and yes , as members of the bourgeoisie . <p> <p> By Fred Baumann <p> <p> Fred Baumann is associate professor of political science at Kenyon College , Gambier , OH 43022 . <p> 
##4000365 Section : ISSUES <p> A Cleveland Plain Dealer article refers to the " skyrocketing population figures of blacks and Hispanic youth . " Time magazine devoted its 9 April 1990 cover story to " America 's Changing Colors , " and asked on its cover , " What will the U.S. be like when whites are no longer the majority ? " These new demographics , as such projections are frequently and approvingly called , are invoked by educators to argue that inevitable demographic changes require a transformation of American schools and colleges , particularly in curriculum . This is one of the most popular ideas in American education today . Proclaimed in educational publications , reports , and conferences , it is ubiquitous and unchallenged . Workforce 2000 <p> The source of the new demographics is Workforce 2000 , a report that has proved far more influential than its authors probably envisioned . Workforce 2000 deserves much of the attention it has received . Published in 1987 by the United States Department of Labor , it compiles studies by the Hudson Institute on the nation 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The purpose of Workforce 2000 is to alert policy makers of the social changes that may affect American productivity and competitiveness . The research is carefully done , and its implications are effectively elaborated . Sparing the readers social scientific jargon , the report is also refreshingly readable . <p> The serpent in the garden , however , is this short sentence : " The cumulative impact of the changing ethnic and racial composition of the labor force will be dramatic . " 1 Somebody got carried away rhetorically , and the editors let it slip by . For this statement simply is not substantiated . <p> The report does show that by the year 2000 women , blacks , Hispanics , and immigrants will make up 85 percent of new job seekers . But this is the percentage of new job seekers , not the percentage of the total workforce . More importantly , the categories themselves are misleading because white women are the largest " minority " group listed . White women , according to Workforce 2000 , will account for 42 percent of new entrants into the workforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white and nonwhite , will account for 22 percent , leaving 20 percent to native nonwhite males and females , and 15 percent to native white males . These numbers seem to indicate a revolutionary transformation of America 's ethnic profile -- but only if one forgets that white women have been included in the minority population , and only if one confuses new job seekers with the total workforce or the total population . <p> According to Workforce 2000 , " black women will comprise the largest share of the increase in the non-white labor force . " In fact , " black women will outnumber black men in the workforce . " This statistic suggests that the increase in the numbers of working black women is due more to their being women than to their being black . It does not prove that the total percentage of the population that is black is increasing dramatically . <p> Nevertheless , the new demographics have popularized the notion that minorities will become the majority over the next couple of decades . That simply is not true. 2 Minority groups as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 are increasing in inverse proportion to their relative size . That is to say , the most rapidly growing minority groups are also the smallest ( see table 1 ) . <p> Asians are the fastest growing minority . Between 1970 and 1980 , America 's Asian population grew 143 percent , but Asians make up a small percent of the American population . Despite its large growth rate , the Asian population grew from only 0.7 percent of the American population in 1970 to 1.5 percent in 1980. 4 The highest estimates suggest that by the year 2000 , Asians may grow to as much as 4 percent of the population . Similarly , the growth of America 's Hispanic population will not soon make Hispanics a large group . This population grew 39 percent between 1980 and 1989 , a seemingly large rate , but it caused the Hispanic population to grow from only 6.3 percent of the American population to its current 8.2 percent. 5 ( Of course , in California and Texas , Hispanics do make up a large proportion of local communities . ) Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is growing the most slowly of all . Blacks currently constitute about 12.5 percent of the population ; they will make up 13.1 percent by the year 2000 and 14 percent by 2025 . Some Nonimplications for Higher Education <p> The mistaken conclusion that America 's ethnic minorities will become the majority has been eagerly seized on by many educators and taken to a still more absurd extreme , namely , that the population of college students will soon be composed predominantly of minorities . But even if minorities were to become the majority in the total population , the evidence indicates that the same result would not be achieved , at least not automatically , in the student population . American Indians , for example , are underrepresented in higher education when compared to their fraction of the population of the United States . In 1988 , American Indians made up only 0.7 percent of American college enrollments. 6 Asians are well represented , but they constitute a small fraction of the population . College-age blacks ( like college-age whites ) are actually a shrinking cohort . From 1979 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 11 percent. 7 The Hispanic population is growing in the United States , but this fact does not automatically translate into hopeful projections for college attendance . According to a study by Arthur Levine and Associates : <p> The growth of Hispanic enrollment is not yet fully apparent in secondary and postsecondary education because the Hispanic population is very young , it continues to drop out of high school at a high rate , and the fraction of Hispanic high school graduates going on to college has declined since the 1970s. 8 <p> We all wish that more minorities , especially underrepresented minorities , would attend college . Better practices in grade school and high school and increased transfer opportunities from two-year colleges , where most minority freshman enroll , might help . But even the most optimistic projections of minority participation do not suggest that minorities will transform American higher education . <p> Furthermore , those who draw pedagogic and curricular implications from the new demographics ignore the diversity within the large ethnic categories they feature . For example , to discuss the educational patterns of Hispanics , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former showing relatively dismal participation in higher education , while the latter are well represented . In a similar vein , M. Yukie Tokuyama complains that the Asian groups identified by the United States Census Bureau " exhibit different employment patterns , occupations , incomes , and poverty levels . Moreover , there are differences within subgroups-linguistic , political , educational , generational , and occupational . " 9 Yet , many educators and journalists persist in claiming that broadly-defined minority groups , each assumed to be monolithic , will all demand exactly the same change in higher education . Multiculturalism <p> The change minority students are supposed to demand is that undergraduate curricula should include the study of minority and Third World cultures , necessarily at the expense of the traditional , supposedly " Eurocentric " curriculum . Thus , some educators are using the new demographics to argue for the justice , wisdom , and inevitability of so-called multiculturalism . But even if the exaggerations of the new demographics and its academic corollary were true , do demographic trends really compel curricular changes ? <p> No one ever thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on European cultural achievements , was justified on the ground that most Americans are of European descent . On the contrary , the justification for that curriculum has been that the American polity-its social , economic , and political system-derives from European antecedents and has been informed by the thought of European philosophers . Beyond that , further justification for the European emphasis follows from the fact that liberal education originated in ancient Greece and all of the disciplines it now comprises developed within that tradition , albeit with heavy , repeated , and crucial borrowings from a wide variety of non-European cultures . It is , therefore , not at all obvious that changes in the racial and ethnic makeup of the population should have any effect on college curricula . The purpose of American education has been to prepare our young people for the future and not to tie them to their ancestral past . <p> In what approaches a parody of the argument from demographics to curriculum , Annette Kolodny , dean of the faculty of humanities at the University of Arizona , writes in the Chronicle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , " colleges should change teaching practices : " different cultural groups may emphasize one cognitive style over another-for example , reasoning by analogy instead of strict linear logic . " 10 Dean Kolodny does not identify which cultural groups lack the capacity for logic , though she claims that at one university : <p> young women were using empathy as a learning strategy . What frustrated them was that their instructors rarely introduced specific case histories ; raw data abstracted from case studies made up the bulk of the material presented in the classroom . In that learning context , the men performed better than the women . And the women switched majors . <p> What ugly thoughts lurk behind such statements ? Can women not think as well as men ? Do individuals of different ethnic groups have different mental capacities ? Dean Kolodny does not pause to consider the practical implications such differences would have . <p> Echoing the alarmist rhetoric of nineteenth-century Nativist and Know-Nothing movements , the new demographics proponents picture current immigrants as intractable agents of alien cultures that will forever transform the culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this : because the major sources of American immigration these days are nationalities that ( by chance ) fit America 's conventional taxonomy of minorities ( namely , Asians and Hispanics ) , immigration patterns require a concomitant multicultural response , especially in school curricula . <p> In fact , today 's immigrants largely mirror the culture they are about to join . For example , a recent survey of immigrants found that " the newcomers , whether Arabs , Vietnamese , or other Asians , are mostly Christians . " 11 And Barry A. Kosmin , who conducted the study , stated that " most immigrants are in the mainstream of the Judeo-Christian culture . " ( The survey revealed that 86.5 percent of the immigrants declared that they were Christian , 1.8 percent Jewish , and the balanced stated no religion or simply did not respond . ) If this is true for their religious beliefs , why should we assume that immigrants differ in other cultural respects from the present population of the United States ? In particular , why should we expect that they want their children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans or past immigrants ? Would it not be more reasonable to assume that immigrants come to America , in part , to provide their children the educational benefits our schools are already known to provide ? <p> Besides , there is nothing new about large numbers of immigrants coming to the United States . Consider that in 1980 , 6 percent of Americans were foreign born compared to 9 percent in 1940 and 13 percent in 1920. 12 The United States has a long history of diverse immigration , the most diverse in the New World , according to Roger Daniels , who concludes that although the United States received a variety of Europeans during the colonial period , other colonized countries , such as Canada , Australia , and those of Latin America showed a comparatively homogeneous immigrant pattern. 13 Many kinds of immigrants have come to America and enriched it , but they did not come to replicate what they left . Indeed , many wished to escape their native countries ' most pernicious elements . <p> Why encourage minorities to attend college only to deny them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force minority students to undertake a multicultural curriculum at the expense of courses traditional college students took to secure seats in professional schools and careers ? Why insist that minorities should attend college only to change college for them , as if they were not worthy of it as it was ? Thoughtlessness or Worse <p> Proponents of a " multicultural " curriculum advance many arguments to justify their revolutionary demands . Yet their uncritical acceptance of demographic claims unsupported by any evidence -- and the eagerness with which they have used those claims to make " multiculturalism " appear inevitable -- makes one wonder about the character of their commitment . Indeed , their version of multiculturalism fits all too well with the broader desire , evident in certain circles since the 1960s , to denigrate the ideals of the West and to dismantle its institutions . <p> Whether with that motive or merely out of a thoughtless anxiety not to be left off the latest bandwagon , various members of the educational establishment have cited Workforce 2000 as if it were a fiery sword pointing us toward a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford Foundation awarded nineteen American universities " cultural diversity " grants . The program 's goal , a foundation press release explained , was to ensure that colleges " keep pace with the rapid demographic and cultural changes under way in American society . " Franklin A. Thomas , president of the foundation , was quoted : " To teach the roots of intolerance . . . we must make the teaching of non-Western cultures a basic element of undergraduate education . " Similarly , Peter Brooks , director of Yale University 's Whitman Center for the Humanities , defends the assault on the traditional curriculum by asserting : <p> People who say we 've got to return to a core curriculum are just nostalgic for a kind of cultural consensus that just does n't exist anymore . The freshman class at Berkeley is now 80 percent non-white . That gives you a sense of how much America is changing. 14 <p> The last sentence might more accurately read : " That gives you a sense of how much Berkeley is changing . " At any rate , it is safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California does not represent the United States in general , precisely if Brooks 's figure of 80 percent is correct . <p> Consider , also , the proposal that regional accrediting agencies include evidence of student and faculty racial , ethnic , and sexual diversity as part of the criteria for accrediting colleges . In defending such a policy , Stephen S. Weiner , executive director of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges , asserts without qualification that " American colleges and universities are undergoing massive changes in the racial and ethnic composition of their student bodies . " 15 Weiner argues that , " In 1988 , white , non-Hispanic students accounted for 65 percent of California 's college enrollment , compared with close to 80 percent for the nation as a whole . " Exactly : colleges and universities are 80 percent white and not , as Weiner would have us believe , " undergoing massive changes . " <p> Clearly those who are sounding these themes wish that the United States were different from what it is . Some people want public policy to be based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envisioned policies . Responsible educators such as Dale Parnell , president of the American Association of Community and Junior Colleges , have warned that Workforce 2000 has been " widely misquoted. " 16 Yet the new demographics myth persists among many educators and education policy makers . For them , the idea that America 's ethnic mix will soon be transformed appears to be a truth too good to be tested . <p> 
##4000368 Section : REPORTS FROM THE ACADEMY <p> Political correctness in American universities is much discussed and often lamented , recently even in mainstream media ; but the focus is usually on elite schools . Politically correct faculty at universities with lower standing can arguably do more harm , for their students are especially ill-equipped to recognize that indoctrination is being substituted for education . Certainly during my undergraduate matriculation at a second-tier branch of a state university system I encountered many unrelievedly politically correct professors whose ideological biases my classmates seemed unable to identify and articulate . <p> The overwhelming force and rigidity of political orthodoxy became so oppressive in an undergraduate research seminar during my final semester that I felt obligated to challenge it . This effort left me an intellectually demoralized , despairing witness of the professoriate 's ideologically induced indifference -- sometimes , hostility -- to serious debate , contrary viewpoint , and even a sincere search for truth . Several other students also came to loathe the seminar , but I do not believe they dearly understood the cause of their dissatisfaction or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideological presuppositions instead of benefiting from a truly open inquiry . <p> I joined this seminar because one of my professors , I will call him the Ethicist , strongly encouraged me to do so . Our usual rapport had recently been strained because I had charged in a student evaluation that his personal ethics class had been extremely biased in favor of his quasi-Marxist , radical environmentalist , antiindividualist views . So disturbed was he by my criticisms that he sought me out to defend his pedagogy -- with the unnerving observation that he has " only fourteen weeks to make students question the values of the dominant culture . " I retorted that I did n't see his role as that of deprogrammer but as educator . This unpleasantness notwithstanding , he recruited me for the forthcoming seminar on Indian treaty rights , 1 a project about which he was most enthusiastic . And because I initially thought that the legal issues involved would place a moderately libertarian person like myself on the side of the pro-minority angels , I signed on . What Are Indian Treaty Rights ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its faculty requires some historical background and an explanation of the Indian treaty rights controversy now raging in northern Wisconsin . As the result of successful litigation initiated by the Chippewa against the State of Wisconsin in the mid-1970s , they are allowed special hunting , fishing , and timber harvesting rights not enjoyed by other citizens , including all other Indians . Initially , the court determined that the Chippewa were entitled to 100 percent of the " maximum allowable harvest " of various fish and game species on the lands they sold to the federal government a century and a half ago . The court recently reduced this percentage by half . <p> The judicial reasoning supporting this decision opened the door for the Chippewa also to claim valuable timber on publicly , and possibly privately , owned land in the northern third of Wisconsin . Indeed , among the most worrisome consequences of the Chippewa 's court-awarded rights is that real estate titles throughout the upper third of Wisconsin may have been clouded . As the basis for these resource rights , the Wisconsin Chippewa leadership and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Superior Chippewa and the United States . <p> The court , in addition to accepting the Chippewa 's claims about these treaties , may employ all manner of modern hunting , fishing , and timber-harvesting methods , including spearfishing 2 and gill netting . These fishing methods are otherwise prohibited in Wisconsin because they can bleed a lake of its maximum allowable harvest in one day , thereby dosing it for the rest of the fishing season . Businesspeople in tourism-dependent northern Wisconsin want fishermen to stay at their resorts , eat in their restaurants , and patronize their sportshops . If Chippewa fishing doses a popular lake in their area or drastically reduces the bag limit , these small businesses can lose a great deal . Moreover , sportsfishermen 's fishing-license and club fees keep the lakes stocked with such valued species as walleye and muskie , so when the Chippewa -- who do not pay these fees-spearfish egg-bearing fish , many citizens are angered . Imbalance from the Outset <p> The seminar was composed of a half-dozen students and five faculty members whom I will call Professors Ethicist ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Junior Anthropologist . At our first meeting the faculty handed out a generic syllabus that described various goals of a research seminar , but we students were verbally advised simply to " scratch around " and go wherever our interests took us . Several professors announced the names of possible contacts for our research , all of whom were Indian activists , lawyers with Indian organizations , or journalists . <p> At the second meeting Sociologist and Ethicist suggested we consider undertaking a survey of public opinion on treaty rights , and the latter provided his poll on attitudes about affirmative action as a model . Then several of the faculty showed a film defending treaty rights . None offered information about representatives opposing treaty rights . <p> At the third or fourth meeting I began to grasp the ideological raison d'etre of the seminar and to discover the shallowness of the professors ' scholarly standards . When several described an alleged conspiracy by Exxon and other corporate black hats to funnel money into the anti-treaty rights cause , I quietly listened for some time . Then I stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant funding ; indeed , their movement has the hallmarks of a working-class , seat-of-the-pants operation , one too unsophisticated to have either the financial or the public-relations resources of Exxon behind it . The faculty responded with the assertion that one can not expect to find evidence of such corporate malfeasance because capitalist elites are too " crafty " and " resistant to study " to document their machinations . Lack of proof notwithstanding , several professors made comments throughout the seminar revealing their assumption of sub rosa corporate dastardliness . <p> Because no one else seemed inclined to do so , I decided to interview treaty opponents , with whom I was fully prepared to find fault . The seminar professors had indicated that opponents were calling for " abrogation " of the relevant treaties ; my position was that a Senate-ratified treaty is the law , and its conditions must be upheld and honored . But by the fifth or sixth seminar meeting I had made contact with and closely examined the literature of some anti-treaty rights activists . I discovered that the more astute among them did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seminar participants , these opponents argue that the term-specific stipulations of the treaties in question had been fulfilled by the federal government , most of them in the last century . Furthermore , any issues arising from the inherent inequities of some treaties had been addressed after World War II by the Indian Claims Commission , which ordered additional compensation for the Chippewa as an explicitly final resolution to any residual treaty claims , a condition accepted by the Chippewa and their attorneys at those earlier proceedings . <p> Many opponents argue that the courts invented the controversial treaty rights by accepting , rather eagerly , a historically dubious explanation for one stipulation in the treaties of 1837 and 1842 . Thus , they charge that judicial activism is the source of the Chippewa 's rights . <p> I obtained copies of all the Lake Superior Chippewa treaties , compared them with the language of the other 360-plus treaties between the federal government and various Indian tribes , and determined the treaty rights opponents ' position has merit . Moreover , I managed to acquire a trenchant , unpublished manuscript @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounding them . The author , the nationally known and respected anthropologist James A. Clifton , had been an expert witness for the Chippewa until they realized his scholarship did not support their case . <p> When I related these unanticipated findings to the seminar group , along with my opinion that Clifton 's work seriously undermined the basis for the court 's treaty rights decisions , I hoped to ignite scholarly excitement at the intellectually tantalizing prospect of facts and plausible arguments that run counter to the issue 's standard presentation . <p> The faculty 's reaction was underwhelming . My investigation was all very interesting for those " who are into history and legal issues , " I was advised , but we also need to consider questions of " cultural diversity " and the positive " witness " Indian culture offers the West regarding the environment . Senior Anthropologist asked for a copy of Clifton 's unpublished work , and both he and Archeologist called my attention to an informative newspaper article about Clifton that they had on file . Otherwise , my research met either passive resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was free to continue this line of inquiry but that it was much " too narrow " for them . <p> By the seventh meeting , I had spoken at some length with several members of anti-treaty rights groups . I reported to the seminar that , contrary to the views expressed by the faculty , critics of treaty rights were not necessarily racists . But surely I knew , Sociologist objected , that most racist attitudes are latent and difficult to detect or that their problem may not be racism per se , but a lack of " openness to cultural diversity " ? What was in order , he opined , was an examination of George Orwell 's work on the political uses of language . As an example of the potential enlightenment students might expect from such a course of study , he declared , " I 've never met anybody who was pro-abortion , " the dear implication being that those who use that label , instead of pro-choice , are engaged in unseemly propaganda . When I pointed out that a biologist on campus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state-coerced , unchosen abortion was understandable , Sociologist stared at me for a bit and then said , " Yes , well , he 's in favor of that because of environmental concerns . He 's not pro-abortion , he 's pro-environment . " The Real Seminar Topics <p> The title of the seminar notwithstanding , most of the faculty involved were manifestly uninterested in extensive inquiry and open discussion of the controversy over treaty rights , preferring instead to use the subject as a springboard for their ideological concerns : cultural diversity and antigrowth environmentalism . Because organized opposition to treaty rights is a predominantly white , middle-class movement , the professors could not concede even the possibility of its legitimacy. 3 This class is the bete noire of the advocates of so-called cultural diversity who find bourgeois culture " stupefying , " as Ethicist once put it . They have cast treaty rights opponents as an illegitimate adversary in the several political dichotomies structuring their worldview . To consider opponents ' arguments on their merits would not serve their politically correct dualism of pitting environmentally saintly , oppressed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of promiscuous polluters . I repeatedly challenged these unproven ( and , by the faculty 's own admission , largely unprovable ) stereotypes and dichotomies . The faculty listened to everything I said and then utterly ignored it . I was n't stifled , merely rendered irrelevant . <p> In pursuit of their ideological interests , the seminar professors invited environmentalists to speak to us , encouraged a trip to an anti-mining rally , and chose as their primary seminar project a survey of student and citizen attitudes on environmentalism and treaty rights in Wisconsin . The following are some of the statements that survey subjects were asked to rate according to their agreement or disagreement : <p> I believe scarcity of resources will limit the world 's economic growth in the next ten to twenty years . <p> Humans are different from other creatures but should not be considered superior to them . <p> The natural environment can not sustain present levels of the world 's economic growth . <p> Economic growth must be limited to protect the environment . <p> It is probably too late to prevent environmental catastrophe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must learn to care more about the balance of nature and less about economic growth . <p> Commercial development in Wisconsin is more important than treaty rights . People in American society should try to get along with nature as traditional native Americans have done . <p> I protested that most of the survey questions were irrelevant to the ostensible subject of the seminar , and the results of the survey were not difficult to predict . Those initiated in the doctrines of political correctness would give the right answers while working- and middle-class people in economically depressed northern Wisconsin would find limiting economic growth ridiculous . Thus , the survey team would find a positive correlation between environmentally conscious ( good ) subjects and support for treaty rights , as well as some correlation between those less supportive of the radical environmentalism reflected in the survey questions and objection to treaty rights . Thus it is proven : the morally right-minded support treaty rights . <p> Students who completed the survey were advised " that there are no right or wrong answers . " However , the naked biases and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For instance , when I pointed out that Ted Williams , a respected sports journalist , environmentalist , and contributing editor of Audubon magazine , had published a cogent critique of treaty rights and the mythology of Indian as environmental saint , 4 Junior Anthropologist sought to undermine his credibility by observing that many environmentalists believe Williams is actually a developmentalist . Similarly , when I reminded the professors that one of the campus environmental experts who spoke with us had admitted that some Indian fishing was ecologically harmful and unfair to other fishermen , Ethicist responded with the ad hominem charge that this environmentalist was " a conservative man . " Clearly , the seminar faculty thought there were wrong opinions on environmentalism as well as wrong political proclivities . <p> It is , of course , much easier to design politically correct surveys than to investigate the origins and historical context of nineteenth-century Indian treaties . One of the chief faculty architects of the environmental-attitude survey eventually became frustrated with my persistent references both to what the treaties actually said and their documented meaning for treaty signatories . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had time to read a lot of this stuff . I 've got so much else to do ! " <p> In a final attempt to reason with the faculty regarding the seminar 's predominant focus on environmentalism , I sent all five a memo that complained : <p> I still do n't understand all the attention we are paying to environmental issues in this seminar , at least as we move beyond the question of whether the Indians ' fishing/harvesting rights are or are not dangerous to resources . My concern is that laying an eco-aware template over the various issues relating to Indians detracts from the central points of the controversy . <p> Sociologist responded , in relevant part , " The discussion of environmental issues and environmental conceptions represent an effort to examine different aspects of one dimension of the treaty rights issue . " He claimed that " from the very first " there were three " dimensions that were defined as ( a ) concerns about the environment , ( b ) concerns about fairness and rights , ( c ) concerns about cultural diversity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some ten weeks into the seminar , the faculty had not structured the project short of setting meeting times . There were no required papers or readings , no lectures , and no exams . The weekly seminar meetings were free discussions during which very little of substance was accomplished . That one of the faculty was stipulating intellectual parameters at this point seemed wholly gratuitous . Willful Ignorance and Petty Arrogance <p> In his lengthy response to my memo , Sociologist revealed his deconstructionist bent : " What some might consider simple facts others might view as complex ideological claims . Further , facts are always viewed within the context of a larger view of the natural and cultural world(s) " ( emphasis in original ) . I responded , in a second memo : <p> Some historical facts have such compelling evidentiary support and logical credibility that they are virtually certain , independent of who posits them ( the Holocaust occurred even if the person telling me so is a militant Zionist or the one denying it has an Ivy League Ph.D . ) . And in between this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decreasing likelihood . The best that reasonable people can do when facts are in dispute is to choose a value of likelihood from this spectrum . To resist or downplay efforts to determine historical fact , whatever one 's reasons , is to choose obscurantism . Moreover ; such a choice can be as convenient for those making ideological claims as the manufacture of pseudo-facts . ( Emphasis added . ) <p> I concluded with the observation that the faculty were demonstrating " a decidedly non-neutral antagonism to any perspective on this issue which deviates from what Clifton calls the New Indian Ring . " 5 Several examples of faculty behavior will illustrate the validity of my charge , to which I never received a response . <p> Because several University of Wisconsin at Madison law professors had issued a report describing opponents of treaty rights and their attorney as " precisely analogous " to the Ku Klux Klan , I was astonished to learn that the attorney in question is a Chippewa , a fact of which the law professors may have been aware. 6 His wife , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Women , had published a provocative editorial imploring her " sisters " to stop " romanticizing " life on the reservation . I copied some of this couple 's intriguing compositions and sent them to the faculty with a proposal that they be invited to speak to us , perhaps even to debate their Madison accusers . Sociologist declared he had n't joined the seminar for " that kind of shtick . " The other four professors agreed with him . <p> Because I persisted in pointing out the significant Chippewa presence in the treaty rights opposition , Ethicist and Sociologist finally felt obliged to explain these aberrant Indians by citing the coopting strategy " known " to be employed by various power elites . The other students appeared to accept this latest spin on the conspiracy theory . <p> Not surprisingly , I was the only seminar participant to bring in an opponent of treaty rights ( one of the other students did make an unsuccessful attempt ) . The faculty reaction to his pending visit can only be described as petty and infantile . Displeased to hear that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with smug amusement , asked me what my speaker 's " Indian name " was . Before I could respond , he quipped , " I 'll bet he does n't have one . " When we polled ourselves to determine who would be joining the dinner party for this speaker ( a seminar protocol for most out-of-town guests ) , Junior Anthropologist snidely cracked , " I 'll make up my mind after I hear what he has to say . " <p> After enough such incidents , I confronted Ethicist in his office . First he denied the comments about the Indian speaker 's name . Then he launched into a dizzying display of decon-speak , accused me of " presumption " for believing I knew what he had meant by his remarks , and said that I needed to understand about the " hermeneutics of intentionalism . " This explanation of his attack on the ethnic identity of the Indian treaty rights critic only fueled my outrage , and I advised Ethicist I was considering putting my criticism of the seminar and its faculty in writing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encounter ethical problems , an opinion I have seriously considered and reject . What I write about took place in , or in the context of , a class at a public university , not a confessional . <p> Throughout the seminar most of the faculty participants engaged in entre nous repartee that assumed a common bond of political and religious ( anti-Christian ) correctness among the seminar participants . Sociologist rhetorically asked if the Lutheran synod listed in the credits of a pro-treaty rights film was the one " that did n't require a lobotomy when you joined . " At the end of the semester , with obvious relish and amusement , Junior Anthropologist announced that a student evaluation from another class charged that she appeared to hate white people . She did not infer any legitimate criticism from this student 's observation , nor did her chuckling colleagues , one of whom sighed and stated with mock-resignation , " Yes , it 's a tough job , but somebody 's got ta do it . " In Summary <p> The Indian treaty rights seminar faculty taught me almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seminar . They did not even define their terms . That is , we students were never instructed as to what an Indian treaty is , nor were we shown how the courts extrapolated the controversial new Indian rights from certain treaty stipulations . <p> What they did teach is that undemonstrable assertions , at least when they are grounded in correct politics , constitute legitimate support for scholarly conclusions . On the other hand , solid facts that undermine correct politics can be dismissed by " viewing them within the context of a larger view . " Furthermore , the faculty , who were supposedly dedicated to diversity , demonstrated in word and deed that people whose experiences and perspectives do not support political orthodoxy should be ridiculed and despised or at least ignored . <p> To what degree the other students in the seminar accepted the faculty 's ideologically motivated behavior as valid scholarly praxis , I do not know . I suspect that several of them have accepted it . But such a mockery of liberal education ought to be of concern to academics even if , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classroom serves only to demoralize . <p> 
##4000369 I first heard of student protests at Bowdoin College when I returned there in June of 1990 for my twenty-fifth reunion . Outgoing president Leroy Greason , addressing the assembled alumni , mentioned that at the end of the spring semester , a group of students had staged a rally on the steps of Bowdoin 's Art Museum in support of gay and lesbian studies at the college . Greason said that he met with the students and listened to their demands but made them no promises . The event ended with student leaders walking with Greason back to his office and trying unsuccessfully to change his mind . <p> After Greason 's retirement at the end of the academic year , the students ' demands , which included a formal response by 2 November 1990 , fell to his successor , Robert H. Edwards , who assumed office in the fall of 1990 . He began inauspiciously . In his convocation address and again in his inaugural address , Edwards stressed the college 's commitment to diversity . Then , on October 31 , Edwards responded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay and lesbian studies , by issuing a memorandum " to the college community expressing general support for increased diversity . " Two days later , a group of students , apparently dissatisfied with that response , or , as the alumni newsletter euphemistically put it , " feeling a need for a more specific commitment , " blocked the entrances to the administration building and the library . <p> According to the newsletter 's sketchy account , Edwards met with student representatives and agreed to establish a committee that fall to devise a plan for increasing the number of minority faculty ( including women ) at Bowdoin and to refer a proposal for a gay and lesbian studies program to the faculty . The newsletter concluded by noting that " President Edwards also expressed deep disappointment that the protesters had chosen to block the library . ' Protecting freedom to learn in an open institution is a sacred trust , ' he said . " <p> I , too , was deeply disappointed by the students ' actions , as I told President Edwards in a letter of December 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " freedom to learn in an open institution , " but that they had apparently not been disciplined . On the contrary , Edwards rewarded their efforts by referring their program proposal to the faculty for consideration . Their easy success could only have confirmed the lesson learned by radical students in the 1960s , that where arguments fail to convince , force and intimidation succeed . When the use of force is allowed to play a role in determining curriculum , as at Bowdoin , the integrity of academic procedure is violated . <p> I expressed my fear that faculty consideration of the proposed program would mean , as is often the case with student demands of this nature , that its approval is a foregone conclusion . I suggested that , given the coercive manner in which the students made their demands , their proposal should not be considered . <p> Edwards replied , in a letter dated December 12 , " Every experience I 've had indicates that , when presented by a confrontation that could polarize the campus , it 's best to diffuse it and channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that Edwards and I were working from a number of different assumptions . What he regarded as mere confrontation , I saw as an illegal action by some students that deprived other students of their right to access college facilities . What he saw as a situation that could polarize the campus , I saw as an action that had already polarized the campus , separating those who respect the rule of law from those who respect force . Where Edwards conceived the president 's role as diffusing disorder by acquiescing to the demands of the party causing the disorder , I believed he should enforce the rules that define the college community . <p> To provide details on the student protest and his view of the circumstances surrounding it , Edwards included with this letter several documents : his memorandum of October 31 to the Bowdoin community and the Coalition for Diversity , his statement to the student protesters on November 2 , and his memorandum of November 5 to the trustees and overseers of Bowdoin College . He also included a copy of the coalition 's November 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Edwards called diversity " the greatest issue facing American society , " and announced that " I have reiterated my conviction that Bowdoin must create a more welcoming environment for cultural , racial , religious , and socio-economic diversity . " <p> Most alumni must have been surprised to learn that Bowdoin 's atmosphere was less than congenial to groups of people long considered welcome at the college . Edwards did not suggest what made the environment unwelcoming , nor when the negative transformation occurred , nor what could be done to improve the situation . He simply offered an obscure and unsubstantiated indictment of the college 's atmosphere after being on campus only ten weeks . <p> Edwards 's memo also affirmed that " race and gender , as issues , are treated widely throughout the curriculum . " This fact , he said , " demonstrates Bowdoin 's awareness that , although many students arrive on campus ignorant of issues about race , gender , and ethnicity , it is the College 's business that they graduate more enlightened than when they arrived . " Enlightenment , understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gender , and ethnicity , marks a significant departure from Bowdoin 's traditional sense of its mission as teaching . <p> Edwards ended his memorandum by saying , " Finally , I would emphasize that this note is only a status report . It is not designed to dispose of the question of diversity , but to open discourse on a subject that will never have a ' solution ' but will require unending commitment , tolerance , and energy from all of us . " Edwards made no attempt to justify his discouraging assertion that this subject would never be solved . Significantly , nothing in his memorandum addressed gay and lesbian studies . <p> Hoping for a response , Edwards delivered his October 31 memorandum in person to a meeting of the Coalition for Diversity , but November 1 passed without an answer . In his November 5 memorandum to trustees and overseers , Edwards explained what happened next : " About 7:00 a.m. on November 2 a group of about 40 students blockaded the entrance to the Library and to Hawthorne-Longfellow Hall . They demanded that the president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's demands read as follows : <p> The " status report " presented to the Coalition of Concerned Students on October 31 is inadequate . As previously stated , we demand : a significant increase in the number of faculty from minority groups ( including women ) reflecting the demographical percentages of these groups in the United States . the creation of a position in Gay and Lesbian Studies . <p> The document asked the president to affix his signature to these demands as well as to the following demands : <p> We the Coalition of Concerned Students demand that no disciplinary action be taken against staff members who could not enter the Hawthorne-Longfellow building on November 2 , 1990 . Furthermore , we demand that no disciplinary action , such as dismissal , on the part of Bowdoin College , be taken against students , faculty and staff involved in the protest . <p> The November 5 memo continues the chronology of events following the blockade of the library : <p> By 9:20 a.m . Dean Lewallen had invited 5 or 6 students to the Afro-American Center Library to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my inquiry as to why there had been no discussion , " when the door was open , " I was told that the memo was a regurgitation of what was known ; gave no clear indication as to the action that would be taken , whereas my statement on the budget has promised an interim answer by June of 1991 ; and made no explicit mention of the gay-lesbian demand . <p> Edwards said that he explained to the students the limits of his power to grant their demands , reiterated his agreement " on the diversity issues generally " ( suggesting for the first time that he included gay and lesbian concerns as matters of diversity ) , and proposed language he thought would be acceptable to the students . <p> Following his meeting with student representatives , Edwards went to the library to address a group of " some 50 to 60 students " who were still blocking the building 's entrance . Edwards found the protester " in a cheerful humor " but noted that " there were beginning to be disagreements between the protesters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered the following address to the assembled students : <p> Good morning to all of you . I just wanted to say to all of you that I am warmly in accord with your cause . But as your new president , you need to know -- and I say this from the bottom of my heart to you -- I am deeply disappointed that you have decided to block the library . <p> Libraries represent liberal learning and freedom of education and freedom of thought , and my understanding is that 's what you all stand for . You 've chosen the wrong symbol to block , because blocking libraries and burning books is what happens in fascism in Europe and you need to know that . That 's the starting point . OK ? But secondly -- and let me say -- when this is over , I want you to know that I want to have a continuing discourse with you , because I believe in this cause and I 'm strongly with you . <p> I want you to know that this is a statement that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your group . It says : <p> As I stated in my memorandum of October 31 , I am committed as president of Bowdoin College to expanding diversity at the College . . . . <p> To that end , <p> 1 . I shall meet with department and program chairs in the coming week to establish procedures for advancing this goal through recruitment in the 1991 season . I will also act to establish a committee that will begin work this fall to produce a plan , with time goals , for securing at Bowdoin a significant increase in the number of faculty from minority groups ( including women ) reflecting the demographic percentages of these groups in the United States . I would expect the committee to produce a hard interim report by June 1991 . . . . <p> 2 . I shall introduce to the faculty the proposal to establish a program in gay and lesbian studies and the staffing such a program would require . <p> That being so , I would ask you to disperse from the doors of the library and allow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Emphasis in original . ) <p> " I believe , " wrote Edwards of the response to his address , " there was relief all around when the statement was read . " The relief was understandable , because Edwards had just handed the protesters everything they demanded , and they no longer had any reason to prohibit other students from using the library . Some of the protesters lay on the ground an additional fifteen minutes and then dispersed . <p> Edwards continued the November 5 memo with a self-assessment and a look forward : <p> How would I interpret all this , and what might it bode for the future ? There is a head of resentment at Bowdoin , and on a number of other campuses , on the diversity question . At Bowdoin , although there are some who are obdurate and want publicity , most genuinely seek more social , racial , and personal diversity and a welcoming atmosphere for them on the campus . <p> Edwards is obviously conversant with the political implications of diversity and is quick to recognize that some ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept it unquestioningly . He therefore divided the campus population into two groups , the right-thinking majority who support diversity and the publicity-seeking opposition . Anticipating that the hard-hearted publicity seekers will continue to resist the mollifying suasions of the diversity camp , Edwards looked to the future with guarded optimism : <p> I believe we can make progress , but would caution that progress will not mean a solution or tranquillity . The more diversity we create , the more the campus will become a forum for expression by those who have suffered prejudice and indignity . This will not necessarily be calm , and it will require steadfastness because this will be the American social agenda of the ' 90s . <p> Edwards , who acceded to the demands of protesters to avoid polarization , pledged himself to keeping the campus in a state of constant polarization . There will be neither tranquillity nor calm , he said , as we pursue the social agenda he proclaims for our entire country for the remainder of the century . Edwards then returned to his assessment of the protest itself : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement responding to student demands made undertakings that would have been quite reasonable to agree to in open discourse . The Library and Hawthorne-Longfellow Hall returned to normal after about four hours of disruption , without angry confrontation and polarization of the campus . I believe the protesters now understand the gravity with which the College will view interruptions of its academic processes . The deans will be taking steps to ensure that students henceforth understand the disciplinary consequences of such action . <p> In the only humorous remark I ran across in many memos , Edwards suggested that protesters will now begin to fear the judgment of his administration . On the contrary , the deans might spare themselves the effort of making students " henceforth " understand the consequences of library-block-ing ( as if students normally arrive at Bowdoin without any notion of decorum , rules , or the order of law ) . The students already understand full well the disciplinary penalties of their actions and look forward to being treated again to hollow strictures ( " You 've chosen the wrong symbol to block " ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are happy to achieve something less than they demand ; these protesters asked for a slice of bread and received a loaf . Their statement demanded the creation of a position in gay and lesbian studies . Edwards promised to propose a program in gay and lesbian studies and the staffing such a program would require , thus revealing a greater enthusiasm for gay and lesbian studies than the protesters themselves demonstrated . <p> That enthusiasm is evident in the conclusion of the November 5 memo : <p> Regarding gay and lesbian studies , the College has established procedures for considering new academic programs which are faculty-driven , and gay rights is a volatile and political issue , with much potential for militancy and backlash . The faculty understand the importance of the College 's taking control of the issue , creating a rational process for analyzing it as an academic question-evaluating the research , disciplinary base , and theory that exist -- before considering the appropriateness of a new program at Bowdoin . The issue will be discussed at the coming faculty meeting . <p> Thus , Edwards injected the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' statement of November 2 did not mention and which does not follow from his earlier reference to the academic issue of gay and lesbian studies . And once again , he attempted to discredit any opposing view in advance by yoking it with such strongly negative concepts as " backlash " and " militancy . " <p> As his various correspondence makes clear , Edwards regards diversity as the central concern of Bowdoin or of any college or university today . Just as clearly , he described that issue in Manichean terms , with good will and moral right on the side of diversity and ill will and immoral views on the other side . He took an advocacy position and , while pretending that nonaligned persons are welcome within the diversity camp , really left no neutral ground . However , as college president , he can not act as both advocate and judge . <p> In ending his letter to me , Edwards made a heavily hedged acknowledgment of a position on campus opposed to his own : " There are , incidentally , strong indications that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success , tactics like blocking the library produce antibodies of resistance that deflect attention from the very cause the protesters seek . " However , within less time than it takes to study for a final exam , the protesters received agreement to all their demands , and more . To suggest that the tactic of blocking the library produced anything less than total victory for the student protesters , as Edwards did , is misleading . <p> In all that Edwards writes , a great deal is left unsaid . Nowhere does he admit that the opposition has valid arguments . Much has been written against affirmative action and a curriculum driven by political concerns . On campuses across the country , there are professors who question the appropriateness of a separate discipline devoted to homosexuality ( what of heterosexual studies ? ) . I mentioned the last of these points in my letter to Edwards , but he wrote nothing in response . <p> Similarly , Edwards left a great deal unsaid about his own views , which are offered without substantiation . He asserted that Bowdoin must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small college in Maine with a long history of drawing the majority of its students from Maine and Massachusetts should mirror the demographics of all fifty states . <p> Edwards 's reaction to the library incident is easier to understand in light of statements made in his convocation address , in which he saw " a fresh task before us of dimensions even greater , in a way , than those early Congregationalists faced when they set forth Bowdoin as a light and a beacon on what they considered to be their ' errand into the wilderness . ' " Judging that " we have perhaps yet another wilderness before us , " Edwards asserted that Bowdoin 's new mission is " to create a just and cultivated society . " Continuing the theme of social engineering , Edwards said he came to Bowdoin " with no interest in control , but with great interest " in engaging the college community " in defining the meaning of culture in modern America . " He went on to include within that sphere of definition not only " knowledge and understanding " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed Bowdoin 's nearly 200-year-old mission from imparting knowledge and transmitting culture to creating a new society and defining culture ( including behavior ) . His promotion of the cause of homosexual studies and even of gay rights may be the first step in fulfilling the college 's new charter . <p> Through all his memoranda , addresses , and statements , it becomes apparent that Edwards believes not so much in allowing diversity to exist as in imposing " diversity , " coupled with a studied antagonism toward any opposing point of view . I found myself agreeing with Edwards on one matter : in the next few years , Bowdoin can look forward to troubled times . <p> By Gary Crosby Brasor <p> <p> Gary Crosby Brasor , formerly assistant professor of French at Howard University , is a policy analyst at Digital Equipment Corporation , 200 Forest Street , Marlboro , MA 01752 . <p> 
##4000371 As students of power relations have known for years , Machiavellian strategies can operate in academic departments just as they do in the larger world . Indeed , with such ideals as objectivity , rationality , and the disinterested pursuit of truth now subject to widespread ridicule by ideological militants and devotees of postmodernism , hardball politics may be more commonplace on campus than off . Unfortunately though , among the torrent of books and articles documenting the rising influence of academic ideologues , there has been little if any attempt to analyze the concrete political strategies by which activist faculty gain and perpetuate their power . This article is intended to rectify this oversight and to propose some acceptable countermeasures for those who wish to resist . The Ideological Cartel and Departmental Governance <p> Prof. Holley H. Ulbrich recently coined the term academic cartel to describe a small , closely knit group of professors who seek to enhance their academic standing and vocational benefits by dominating the decision-making machinery of a department. 1 Understanding university life as characterized by fluid coalitions that shift in response to changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " circumstances peculiar to academe virtually guarantee a lifetime for the departmental cartel that is brief . " 2 Our view , however , is that this fairly benign prognosis seriously underestimates the contemporary power of shared ideology and common political cause to neutralize " circumstances peculiar to academe , " freeze alignments , and extend the existence of departmental cartels indefinitely . Cartel Strategies <p> The key goal of an ideological cartel is to capture the departmental chairmanship , for it is the occupant of this position who usually appoints committees , defines and redefines jurisdictions , writes job descriptions and agendas , oversees peer review , and establishes the framework for hiring . As intermediary between dean and department , the chairman also exercises substantial control over the flow of information to higher levels , shaping impressions about the relative merits and contributions of the department 's members . This differential evaluation is often accompanied by what Richard Rorty calls " a lot of ad hoc departmental rhetoric " contrived to reeducate the powers that be about " the nature of the discipline . " 3 Once an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other strategies for cartel maintenance become far easier to execute . These are addressed in the following paragraphs . <p> The incremental transformation of the department 's agenda . The composition and orientation of a department are the cumulative result of successive decisions about courses and hiring . Continuity of control over these decisions is maintained by appointing cartel members as chairmen of departmental committees having jurisdiction over course additions , course deletions , the rewriting of course descriptions , and program reviews . Given enough time , the curriculum decisions made by these committees will restructure faculty needs and determine recruiting . When they do , two crucial consequences follow : noncartel faculty are gradually marginalized and rendered vulnerable to pressure to switch departments , seek jobs at other institutions , or take early retirement , and future recruiting focuses on those who share the cartel 's ideological vision of the discipline . <p> The dissolution of fixed structures . This strategy replaces permanent bodies possessing established jurisdictions and elective memberships with ad hoc ones appointed by the chair . These bodies are then empowered to make policy and procedural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The manipulation of information . Even when a departmental vote can not be avoided , control can still be maintained by withholding information until university deadlines are at hand . Then , cartel members -- having already determined their own position -- call the required meeting and force votes on policies that others have had little or no time to evaluate . <p> Cartel members can complement this strategy by reducing the number of departmental meetings ( easily done , for few faculty members campaign for more meetings ) . Infrequent meetings make it harder for noncartel members to pool knowledge from noncartel sources about emergent policy changes , and they prevent dissidents from confronting cartel leaders with potentially embarrassing questions . <p> The development of flexible evaluation methods so that performance scores of cartel members can be inflated in areas of responsibility they prefer to avoid . There are activities that university administrators respect but do not generously reward . To remain " respectable , " cartel members must avoid these burdens without incurring onus . Unfortunately , teaching ( especially of undergraduates ) is frequently regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often teach inordinately heavy loads , thereby subsidizing the minimal teaching responsibilities of those inside the cartel. 4 In universities where teaching accounts for a sizeable percentage of the annual evaluation , policies must be manipulated to ensure that cartel members receive ratings equal or superior to those carrying the heavier burdens . This can be accomplished by various techniques , including preferentially assigning more lightly enrolled elective courses to cartel members or allowing them to teach seminars that do not require much preparation . Releasing time from teaching in return for nominal administrative assignments is yet another way to allow the favored to look better than they deserve . Adroit information management and appropriate obfuscation can hide these privileges from any but the most persistent inquiry . <p> The use of gossip to discredit dissidents . Accusations and rumors of sexual harassment , problem drinking , crankiness , lack of congeniality , or insubordination can irritate institutional sensibilities and identify the accused as " the other . " 5 This transforms legitimate intellectual differences into a question of personal failure , thereby discrediting criticism . <p> The suppression of academic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some larger university mandate . This maneuver requires a powerful act of intimidation to deter future debunking . For example , cartel members can seize an argument designed to reaffirm , in the midst of ideological dominance , the legitimacy of a nonideological perspective and reinterpret it as an attack on the moral purposes of the institution . This becomes easier as colleges and universities , often without much reflection , adopt vague mission statements on the importance of diversity , multiculturalism , and a sensitive learning environment . Cartel members can present the " subversive " argument to sympathetic university officials when its author is not on hand to rebut the argument 's misconstruction . At appropriate moments , the cartel departmental chair can then state or , even better , merely hint that senior administrators found the dissident position " disturbing . " Challenging Cartel Dominance <p> Most of those likely to be left out of ideological cartels entered the academy not out of any zest for confrontation but to enjoy the calm , quite pursuits of scholarship and teaching . But , as Machiavelli says , when " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not " change his mode of proceeding . " 6 Thus , when confronted by an ideological cartel , professional survival may well require developing a combativeness not originally thought part of the academic job description . For those willing to summon the appropriate resolve and application the following course is recommended . <p> Document everything . Since the leaders of the cartel have kept files and bestride the official channels of communication , it is necessary to retain memoranda , letters , announcements , and meeting agendas ( as well as to take minutes independently ) in order to document procedural tricks and double standards . Dissidents need such records to establish their credibility with administrators . <p> At every opportunity aggressively and openly question cartel policies . The question mark , as Saul Alinsky observed , is an inverted plowshare , a " carrier of the contagion of curiosity . " 7 Asking pointed questions at committee and departmental meetings forces cartel members to formulate convincing and internally consistent justifications for salary decisions , teaching assignments , committee appointments , and procedures in general . Forcing them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or force cartel members to adhere to more evenhanded procedures , thereby weakening the cartel 's effectiveness . <p> Promote counter-pressure . Ulbrich advises dissidents to " raise the costs of cartel behavior by constant monitoring , by grievances , by complaints flied with the higher administration , and by establishing a reputation for the cartel among other academic departments so as to predispose any grievance hearing toward the grievant and . . . to create alliances within the local academic community that may bear fruit in the future . " 8 A problem does not exist until people define it as such ( to paraphrase Alinsky ) . 9 Encouraging colleagues to visit deans and air their complaints , either individually or collectively , alerts administrators that all is not well . A series of memos exposing the cartel , particularly from someone who has both seniority in the profession and tenure in the department , can also be very effective . <p> Redress intellectual power imbalances by calling in outsiders and create new forums for discussion . To legitimatize intellectual alternatives , dissidents can cite respected scholars from other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring these professors to the campus as speakers . Dissidents can also sponsor educational programs , for example , brown-bag luncheons , focusing on such topics as departmental governance or the erosion of academic freedom . <p> Press colleagues to take a stand . In circumstances of ideological oppression , faculty must be aware of the Machiavellian necessity to choose : <p> A prince is also esteemed when he is a true friend and a true enemy , that is , when without any hesitation he discloses himself in support of someone against another . This course is always more useful than to remain neutral , because if two powers close to you come to grips , either they are of such quality that if one wins , you have to fear the winner , or not . In either of these two cases , it will always be more useful to you to disclose yourself and to wage open war ; for in the first case if you do not disclose yourself , you will always be the prey of whoever wins , to the pleasure and satisfaction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , nor anything , to defend you or give you refuge . For whoever wins does not want suspect friends who may not help him in adversity ; whoever loses does not give you refuge , since you did not want to share his fortune with arms in hand. 10 <p> Those who prefer others to do their fighting for them forfeit their claims to respect and risk coming to grief however things turn out . Once the campaign against the cartel acquires real momentum , fence-sitters should be reminded of this basic fact of life . <p> Alert college administrators to the fact that ideological cartels can expose the institution to embarrassment . It is becoming increasingly obvious that administrators who allow ideological cartels to flourish open themselves to embarrassment when the media and public observe the intolerance , zealotry , and abuses of power that these cartels engender . Repeated allusions in appropriate campus forums to conspicuous examples of such embarrassment may eventually penetrate the consciousness of even the most resistant provost or academic dean . <p> When all else fails , inform the media , the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a high-risk venture to be considered only in serious situations when there is no further internal recourse , iniquitous policies that for ideological reasons may pass muster within colleges and universities almost always look different when exposed to broader scrutiny . Moreover , savvy administrators may sometimes welcome such exposures as a means of weakening or overthrowing cartels they are otherwise helpless to confront . Needless to say , however , the personal costs of following this course may prove high for the whistle-blower . Conclusion <p> In the past , it was believed that the commitment of scholars to the canons of reason and evidence prevented the ideological capture of most academic departments . However , such transformations not only take place but do so through strategies that are likely to render them permanent . In these new circumstances , those holding traditional academic values may find themselves defined or harassed out of professional existence . As unpleasant as it may be , scholars must learn to recognize and respond to these attempts , which are likely to become increasingly common in the 1990s . These days , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hasten one 's ruin . <p> 
##4000372 Section : ISSUES <p> I am taking it as given that politicization and low academic standards are the enemies of liberal education , that those enemies are currently in the ascendant , that my readers agree with me about this , and that they agree with me about little else . <p> There are two questions that I wish to address in this essay . The first is : In what sense of " defense " is liberal education in need of defense ? The second is : What are we defending ? Both questions turn on the difference , to put it crudely , between philosophy and politics , or , if you wish , between theory and practice or between scholarship and action . <p> Scholars accentuate their disagreements . They like to sharpen the issues . The deeper each goes into a question , the more he disagrees with every other scholar . And that is all to the good . It furthers understanding . Scholars , in addition , wish to win battles by fact and logic , not by the number of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement who does not understand it , that is disagreeable . But in a political battle , it does not matter why you vote with me as long as you do . Our agreement need only be practical , not philosophical . That is why politics makes strange bedfellows . The art of finding a ground on which we who agree about little can , nevertheless , stand together is not an art to be despised . It is , nonetheless , a political not a philosophical art . <p> Because scholars disagree about matters of fundamental import , they will not agree about the essence of liberal education . For the idea of liberal education is part of a network of ideas -- about knowledge , human nature , society , and God -- that are essentially contested . If we could agree about the exact form and contents of an ideal curriculum , we would already possess answers to all the unanswered questions that make liberal studies so lively an enterprise . Our failure to agree on a definition of liberal education is , therefore , as it ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should teach the questions . But that is no answer . For we also disagree about which questions are meaningful , which are important , and which are still unanswered . In addition , this emphasis on questions obscures -- and perhaps is meant to obscure -- the fact that there is a great deal of knowledge that is almost beyond question , much of which should be conveyed to our students . Indeed , one of the most prevalent forms of contemporary politicization is an exaggerated emphasis on questions . For this has the effect of undermining the entire enterprise : its covert message is that there is no truth to be had and , hence , that questions are not to be taken seriously , that liberal studies are a game , and that nothing of importance remains except political commitment unqualified by information or reflection . Plying a sea of questions without the ballast of knowledge is a dangerous business . No wonder so many students and schools capsize . Furthermore , not to teach that which is known , and not to insist on accuracy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our inadequately prepared college students and to perpetuate the low standards to which they have become habituated . And pandering breeds boredom . For one must first know something , before he can find the deeper questions intelligible , much less exciting . <p> So we are back to the fact that those of us who are most concerned to defend liberal education do not agree on its definition . This theme can be developed in greater detail than I have room for here . For example , many of those with a religious orientation claim that the root of politicization goes back to the same Enlightenment conceptions to which others appeal in opposing politicization . Hence , while on the issue of the moment we may agree , that agreement is like a sheet of ice over the liquid depths of more interesting disagreements . <p> That would be fine , if our interest were purely philosophical . However , we do not oppose politicized scholarship in idea merely . Instead , it is an immediate practical threat , undermining all our versions of liberal education . Nor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in arguing the issues . Instead , his object is power , not truth , and therefore he is unmoved by rational argument . Thus the defense liberal education needs is political , not philosophical . To see what this defense requires , let us examine the character of politicization more closely . Politicization 's Progress <p> How did the academy become politicized ? What were the rest of us doing ? Why did we let it happen ? It all seems so improbable -- so much so , indeed , that many people , both in and outside the academy , have trouble believing it is a fact . The explanation has several parts , but the major part has been overlooked , just because it stares us in the face : the politicized minority gained power precisely because it is politicized and the rest of the professoriate is not . Preferring power to truth , the politicized scholar can be ruthless , hence , efficient , in the pursuit of power . <p> Had genuine scholars been interested in power , they would not have become scholars . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Left in the 1960s . Having succeeded as students in imposing their will on entire institutions , they naturally wanted to continue the fun as adults -- and to make their livings at it . So they became scholars , of a sort , while retaining their commitment to " activism . " And they succeeded easily -- just as easily as they had won their student victories over reason and fair play . Hence the advent of the well-named " Tenured Left . " <p> It is true that by the 1960s , scholarship and teaching had already declined to the point where they were vulnerable to any intrusion bearing some signs of vitality . The curriculum had already become a wasteland of arid professionalism and premature specialization . Coherence and educational purpose were long since sacrificed on the convenient altar of student choice ( merely an excuse for teachers to pursue their scholarly specialties in undergraduate courses ) . This was the fertile field on which fell the seed of the weed called " relevance . " And many professors had become so involved in shallow careerism that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were not unhappy to gain a little extra time for their research , when student " activists " managed to shut down classes or put an end to grading . The same sort of professors are unperturbed today when their colleagues debase the curriculum with undemanding political content . It is also true that many of those who were paying attention lacked any defense against radical demands . Always they said , " Well , I do n't like their tactics , and they are going too far , but it 's in a good cause and I can not oppose them . " The same sort of professors are still saying that , but now it is about what their colleagues are doing . They profess to care about the rights or welfare of women and minorities , but in fact they do not care enough to oppose the outrageous things being done in their names . Nor do they understand the purposes of education sufficiently to see why the curriculum should not be politicized " in a good cause . " <p> Essential as these factors are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have to recognize , in addition , that psychologically and institutionally the academy was not -- is not -- prepared to withstand the importunities and stratagems of the politically motivated . I have already touched on the psychological aspect -- the fact that genuine scholars are not girded for battle . Indeed , one might go further : a major impetus of scholarship -- beginning with Plato 's founding of his school in the original groves of Academus -- is to retreat from the hurry-burly of political strife , the better to understand it . Scholars are by nature the men and women least inclined to sacrifice accuracy and nuance to the crude demands of political rhetoric , and they are the persons least inclined to sacrifice to the exigencies of the moment that leisure which is necessary to their taking a large view of things . It should therefore surprise no one that genuine scholars have not been very good at defending themselves from the dirty work done by their politicized counterfeits . <p> But more important than psychological considerations is the fact that the academy as an institution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of governance evolved to protect it from external political pressures but not to protect it from organized internal pressures to conform to a particular political program . Internally , that system serves to protect our enterprise from the biases that vary with individuals and from those plays for power to which overweening ambition leads an occasional scholar . It presupposes that nearly all academics have at least a large measure of commitment to the traditional goals of teaching and learning . It does not work when there is a sizeable minority who share essentially the same political goal and who are shameless in their pursuit of the power to advance that goal -- at whatever cost to truth and education . This is the reason the academic Left has succeeded in taking control of higher education , despite the fact that a ( diminishing ) majority of professors remain unpoliticized . <p> When faculty debates and committee deliberations -- never to tell the truth , noted for their high intellectual level -- are undermined by the concerted action of those who plan their strategies beforehand , who applaud speakers on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard big lies , such as that Western civilization is racist and sexist ) , and who do all they can to distract attention from the arguments of the " other side " and to intimidate those who dare make such arguments ( especially by calling them racists and sexists ) , then the system no longer works . For it depends on a certain amount of civility , intellectual honesty , and multidimensional disagreement -- as opposed to the reduction of every issue to two " sides . " Nor is there any mechanism in place to prevent the academic Left from tirelessly proposing new programs , recycling the same tiresome ideas in ever new forms . Opposition from genuine scholars , who would rather be doing their proper work , is thus exhausted , and students graduate " knowing " little more than that Western civilization is racist , sexist , and " homophobic . " Nor is there any mechanism for monitoring individual classes for such flagrant abuses of academic freedom as irrelevant political harangues , known falsehoods presented as fact , and biased grading . Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chat , forty years ago , was one of the means attempted for external political control of the academy . Defending Liberal Education <p> What , then are we to do ? There is no way out of this ocher than to explain -- clearly , repeatedly , and patiently to all who we can get to listen -- that politicization has changed the game and chat the game can not be restored without changing the rules , at least for the duration . We need to explain that academic freedom , which ordinarily requires independence from outside interference , calls for just such interference when that freedom is being subverted from within . Not that parents or trustees or the public should dictate curricula ; however , they have every right to refuse to fund those institutions that permit their own faculties to violate the principles of academic freedom or that otherwise do not live up to their own pretensions . In addition , we have to build up an internal body of resistance -- a group of faculty and administrators who understand what is at issue , to whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide an alternative in answer to a public call for reform . <p> But for the purpose of gaining public support , as well as to gain the support of our colleagues , we need to be clear not only about what the academic Left is doing but also about what it is that our society is losing thereby . And this brings us to our second question : What shall we defend ? For all talk of strategy and technique is trivial in comparison to clarity about our goal . Nor can we move anyone if we only complain of what is wrong , and are perceived as mere carpers and cavilers . We must also say what it is that we stand for , and we must make that statement inspiring . Despite our philosophical differences , we have to find a common ground on which to make our appeal to colleagues , parents , trustees , and the public . Politicization 's Paralyzing Paradoxes <p> Here we confront a paradox . Scholarship leads us to sharpen our disagreements , rarely to resolve them , while an effective defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can stand together . The language of political campaigns is adopted deliberately . For another form of the paradox is this , that to fight the politicization of scholarship we must become political . This paradox is an enormous stumbling block to us . Our enemies use it to charge us with hypocrisy and those who should be our allies use it as an excuse not to fight . The former say we are just as political as they are , and the latter say that if we spend our time in fighting rather than in teaching and learning , then we have already lost . Both of these arguments are fallacious , just as it is a fallacy to suppose that a peaceful nation may not arm itself against warlike aggressors . Nevertheless , the paradox that underlies those arguments is not so easily dismissed , for it is subject to endless metamorphosis . No sooner have you rid yourself of it in one form than it reappears in another . <p> Consider , for example , the familiar plaint that opposition to politicization is right-wing politicization . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue goes well beyond the fact that politicization is currently from the Left . If that were all there is to it , then we could easily maintain that we oppose all politicization and not only its current leftist form . Furthermore , most of us would be saying that honestly , and few of those we want to convince would doubt that most of us are saying it honestly . But the issue is muddled by the fact that the Left -- I mean the academic Left , for what other Left is there today ? -- has adopted the thesis that all education is political . In consequence , any defense of unpoliticized education is ipso facto a rejection of leftist doctrine . The academic Left seems to have put us in the position of being unable to transcend politics . We either accept their politicization of the academy or , by opposing it , seek to place the academy in opposition to the Left , which , of course , is to politicize it . Deuced clever of them , what ? <p> But it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its doctrine . They did not have to . The idea that all education and all scholarship is political does , of course , have its provenance in Marx 's idea of mystification . But it goes beyond that notion . Marx never said that every idea mystifies . Indeed , it is a corruption of Marxism to suppose that objectivity is impossible or that it is possible only after one has taken a political stance . For Marx himself sought to establish his views by rational argument based in part on historical data . Once upon a time , the Left thought it could win in a fair fight : by facts and by logic , it could win to its own view all those who were not mystified or self-serving . Only in the 1960s did a segment of the Left , namely , the New Left , decide to immunize itself from criticism by holding that everything is political , so that any inconvenient fact or argument could be dismissed as " reactionary . " ( In this , the New Left echoed in doctrine the practice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following every twist and turn of the Moscow-dictated party line . But evil practice is one thing , its justification in theory is another . ) <p> Thus , in opposing politicization , we do not reject leftist doctrine per se . Rather , we reject only the current debased form of leftism . And besides , rejecting a view as ground for academic practice is not inconsistent with giving that view a fair hearing within the academy . In fact , in the present case , the doctrine can not be fairly considered except by not acting upon it ( just as one can not simultaneously practice suicide and think about whether suicide is a good idea ) . For the serious examination of any view is possible only if ( 1 ) objectivity is possible and ( 2 ) we are trying to be objective ; but the idea that all education is political denies ( 1 ) and sanctions the violation of ( 2 ) . It follows that sincere radicals -- those who believe in the truth of what they espouse -- will join with us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shall We Defend ? <p> What idea of liberal education joins the Jesuit and the atheist heir of the Enlightenment , the Orthodox Jew and the Fundamentalist Christian , the libertarian and the socialist in a common cause to save the academy ? I think an answer can be found in the history of liberal education , in the fact that a tradition that began in pagan Greece proved essential to the Christian universities of the Middle Ages and to secular education in modern democracies . For this suggests the existence of some common core that can be conceptualized and used in a variety of quite different ways and yet is identifiably the same thing . <p> The Pythagoreans believed that the study of mathematics liberated souls from their bodily prisons ; it did so because the truths revealed therein were universal and neither served any particular party 's self-interest nor depended on any particular person 's perspective . Thus Proclus credited that sect with creating liberal studies . The same ideal of impartiality is implicit in a religion that claims to be universal , not tribal . The Christian scholar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , in however subordinate a role , the liberal arts continue to serve that end and thus formed , and form , the body of Christian education . Nor is it any accident that modern democracies have fostered the liberal arts . For they , too , despite -- or because of -- their emphasis on individual liberty , depend on a general understanding of the impartial rule of law and of rights deemed universal . Without such an understanding , a democracy will degenerate into an unlimited , unmediated , unmitigated warfare of special interests . <p> Therefore , liberation from limited perspective , granted to us by the acquisition of objective knowledge and by the development of our rational faculties , is the goal of liberal education and makes that education valuable in a variety of contexts . We can disagree about whether a liberal education is complete if divorced from theological instruction ; we can disagree about whether moral teaching must be part of it or must be left merely as a hoped-for consequence of strictly mental training ; but we have to agree that knowledge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of themselves lead to or in conjunction with other things support that self-transcendence without which life is less than human . It is perhaps needless to add that low intellectual standards and politicization are the two wicked arrows that could penetrate liberal education 's heart and kill it . This is especially true of that contemporary form of politicization which teaches that one 's sex or race or class determines one 's " perspective " or " values " or " culture " -- for this is the very denial of the possibility of self-transcendence . <p> As the needs of a democracy are those that will be most generally acknowledged in our society , let us look more closely at liberal education in their light . One frequent criticism of the traditional curriculum is that it is elitist , and that a more democratic curriculum would give equal treatment to the contributions and cultures of all of America 's , or even the world 's , subgroups . I will ignore the problem that there is an enormous number of ways in which millions of people can be subdivided , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Far more important is the fact that the traditional curriculum was indeed designed for an elite group , and that it is therefore precisely the curriculum most needed by today 's democratic citizenry . To begin , again , with the ancient Greeks , liberal studies were those deemed suitable to the gentlemen of leisure whose only responsibility was to take a leading role in their polis . By teaching them a larger view of things and to think for themselves , it prepared them to rule . Since in our democracy the franchise is widespread , that same sort of education must also be widespread . In a democracy it is elitist no ! to make " elitist " education widely accessible . <p> Let us take military , political , and diplomatic history as an example , since that is so often invidiously compared to the " more democratic " social history . Social history , fascinating and valuable as that is , does not teach the art of statesmanship , of which the democratic citizen needs some understanding . It is far less useful to women and black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is to learn how to rule , which means studying what has been done by rulers , especially those of societies most like our own ; and those rulers have been , primarily , white males . It is a tendentious oversimplification , typical of present-day politicization , to suppose that former ruling classes were merely racist and sexist and that we have nothing to learn from them of prudence , statecraft , and practical wisdom . <p> The new , " multicultural " curriculum is not a curriculum for free men and women , prepared to take control of their own futures . It is , instead , a curriculum for those who will remain slaves to their origins , to their sex , race , age , class , handicap , or other peculiarity . It is , thus , inimical to democracy . So , too , is the related devotion of educational institutions to reforming students ' attitudes . In the first place , that really is elitist and antidemocratic , since it means that a self-selected group of educators has decided for all the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Worse yet , it interferes with the transference of knowledge and development of mental skills that is essential to democratic citizenship . A democracy is in peril when its citizens can not think for themselves . Finally , the social reform motive serves as a welcome mat for politicization . If higher education is to perform its true service to democracy , it must drop the project of directly reforming society and return to the task of improving the minds of our young . <p> In conclusion , I think we can agree that the liberal arts tradition we defend is characterized most fundamentally by its quest for objective knowledge , both of historical and cultural peculiarities and of universal principles . Such knowledge lifts us out of the prison houses of our individual selves and peculiar conditions , making morality and democracy possible and supplementing the teachings of universalistic religions . Without this knowledge , partly achieved and partly hoped-for , unanswered questions can not be examined impartially nor taken seriously . Within this framework , there is much we can disagree about , as we can disagree about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clear that such knowledge and such inquiry , as well as the literature ( mostly European ) in which it is embodied and the social forms ( developed in the West ) that support it , are of general import to mankind regardless of one 's origins or present habitation . <p> By Thomas Short <p> <p> Thomas Short is associate professor of philosophy at Kenyon College , Gambier , OH 43022 . <p> 
A review of five measures of cognitive style suggested three underlying dimensions despite differences in the terminology and theoretical bases of these instruments . Consequently , factor analytic methods were used on five measures completed by a sample of 143 students and faculty : the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator , Gregorc Style Delineator , Decision Style Indicator , Learning Style Inventory , and Lifescripts . Results of this analysis identified three underlying factors consistent with predictions , i.e. , a thinking/feeling dimension , an information-processing domain , and an attentional focus dimension . Implications for future psychometric research are discussed . <p> There has been longstanding interest within the behavioral sciences in developing typologies of behavior . Such classification systems have been developed in such areas as personality ( Jung , 1923 ) , learning styles ( e.g. , Gregorc , 1982a ; Kolb , 1976 ) , decision-making styles ( Rowe &; Mason , 1987 ) and social styles ( Christensen , 1980 ; Merrill &; Reid , 1981 ) . Moreover , these various schemes reflect the work of both theoretical and applied researchers in such fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there appears to be little integration across these fields regarding consistent similarities among various classification systems . Examination of such regularities may indeed help elucidate underlying theoretical processes/and or mechanisms ; consequently the purpose of the present study was to examine the conceptual similarity among five different taxonomies of cognitive behavior . Using factor analytic methods , we demonstrate the consistent overlap among these systems and argue for the existence of three primary dimensions of cognitive operation . It is important to emphasize that this work is not meant to be an evaluation , per se , of the quality of the particular measures used to create these taxonomies , but rather , an examination of the implications of the confluence of the models . REVIEW OF FIVE MODELS <p> We begin by reviewing the five models and then present the logic of our conceptual synthesis . Our review requires the explication of the key dimensions of each system ; to aid the reader , we have presented in Tables 1 and 2 the proposed conceptual equivalences among the five . We begin with a discussion of Jung 's model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1923,1971 ) theory of personality types rests upon three orthogonal , bipolar dimensions ( a ) a perceiving dimension , which is concerned with the ways we initially process information ; ( b ) a judging dimension , which characterizes decision-making ; and ( c ) an attentional dimension , which defines preferences for internal versus external focus . One end of the perceiving scale , termed Sensation , is practical , realistic , and present-oriented . Sensing types prefer facts , details , and structure . The opposite perceiving approach , Intuition , reflects a greater concern for meanings and implications rather than raw facts , and with patterns , rather than details . Intuitive types are imaginative and able to quickly recognize relationships in data . <p> Judging is accomplished either by Thinking , the term Jung used to denote an objective , logic-oriented mode of evaluation , or by Feeling , which is more personal and value-oriented . Individuals with a strong Thinking orientation tend to value control while those who lean toward Feeling generally prefer collaboration . <p> Jung also defined two opposing attentional preferences ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which gives more attention to the internal mental process . <p> Jung 's framework is the theoretical foundation of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator ( MBTI ) ( Myers &; McCaulley , 1985 ) , an instrument widely used in counseling , educational , and industrial environments . Myers and Briggs introduced an additional dimension , called Judging-Perceiving , which describes an individual 's preference for organizing or controlling one 's external environment ( judging ) or for understanding these events ( perceiving ) . ( This was not one of Jung 's original dimensions ; moreover , we do not explicitly deal with this dimension in our study . ) <p> Several researchers , e.g. , Hellriegel and Slocum ( 1975 ) , McCaulley ( 1987 ) , have defined a 2 x 2 problem solving/cognitive style matrix by crossing Jung 's perceiving and judging dimensions , i.e. , Sensation/Thinking , Sensation/Feeling , Intuition/Thinking , and Intuition/Feeling . The utility of this taxonomy has been demonstrated in organizational studies of preferred organizational climate ( Mitroff &; Kilman. 1975 ) and executive decision-making ( McKenney &; Keen , 1974 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style is the work of Gregorc ( 1982a , 1982b ) whose four learning style categories are based upon the crossing of sequential or random processing ( dimension 1 ) with concrete or abstract data ( dimension 2 ) . In his theory , " concrete " refers to the immediate experience of new information , no matter how it is dealt with , while " abstract " refers to the mental representation of the experience . Gregorc 's four styles are summarized by Butler ( 1988 ) as follows : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> The preceding description of the Concrete Sequential can be applied to Jung 's Sensation type while the adjectives describing the Abstract Sequential are appropriate for the Thinking type . The Abstract Random description is quite suitable for Feeling types while Intuitives can easily be associated with the Concrete Random learning style . While no studies have directly compared MBTI types with those measured by the Gregorc Style Delineator ( 1982b ) , they have been linked in separate studies involving a third measure , the Kirton Adaptation/Innovation Inventory . <p> Kirton ( 1976 ) proposed two problem-solving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work within the existing situation to solve a problem and tend to be practical , methodical , and conforming . Innovators , on the other hand , question all aspects of a problem , approach it from new angles and challenge rules . <p> Kirton 's descriptions generally coincide with Myers ' ( 1987 , p. 5 ) description of Sensing types who " ... accept and work with what is ' given ' in the here-and-now , and thus become realistic and practical " and Intuitives who " ... grow expert at seeing new possibilities and new ways of doing things . " Indeed , Carne and Kirton ( 1982 ) found significant correlations between Intuitives and Innovators and between Sensates and Adaptors . Joniak and Isaksen ( 1988 ) compared the Kirton and Gregorc instruments and found that Adaptors corresponded to Concrete Sequentials and Innovators to Concrete Randoms . The results of these two studies support the Jung/Gregorc parallel summarized in Table 1 . <p> Additional evidence of the parallelism between the Gregorc and MBTI systems can be seen in the response profiles of men and women taking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scored significantly higher on the Abstract Sequential channel while females scored higher on the Abstract Random channel . Both genders were predominantly Concrete Sequential . Similarly , Myers and McCaulley ( 1985 ) report that on the MBTI males are most often classified as Thinking types ( parallel to Gregorc 's Abstract Sequential ) while most females are typed as Feeling ( Abstract Random ) , and there are many more Sensates ( corresponding to Concrete Sequential ) in the general population than there are Intuitives ( Concrete Random ) . Thus data from the Kirton Inventory , as well as gender differences in response patterns to the two measures , suggest the similarity between MBTI and Gregorc " types . " Decision Style Inventory <p> Rowe 's Decision Style Inventory ( DSI ) ( Rowe &; Mason , 1987 ) has its conceptual foundation in his earlier work with Driver ( Driver &; Rowe , 1979 ) on the use of information in decision making and idea generation . His model is based upon the dimensions of cognitive complexity and environmental complexity . The first term reflects an individual 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern for people- ( vs. task- ) oriented work environment . The four styles derived from this model are : Directive , Analytic , Conceptual , and Behavioral . <p> The Directive Style reflects a practical , present-oriented approach . Directives are autocratic , action-oriented , and prefer structure . Analytics are logical , task-oriented , abstract thinkers . The Conceptual style is associated with creativity , insight , and intuition . Behaviorals are people-oriented , supportive , and receptive . Kolb 's Learning Style Inventory <p> Kolb 's ( 1984 ) learning cycle model represents another conceptual approach to classifying cognitive processing . Based largely on Piaget , Kolb uses the terms abstract and concrete differently than does Gregorc , relating them to Jung 's Thinking and Feeling dimensions . Kolb states that " An orientation toward abstract conceptualization focuses on using logic , ideas , and concepts . It emphasizes thinking as opposed to feeling " while " An orientation toward concrete experience focuses on being involved in experiences and dealing with human situations in a personal way . It emphasizes feeling as opposed to thinking " ( pp. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning theory is that of active experimentation versus reflective observation . In one of the several perspectives that Kolb offers on his theory of learning , he describes his two dimensions respectively as one of grasping information and one of transforming it . Grasping is accomplished by either apprehension ( concrete experience ) or comprehension ( abstract conceptualization ) . The two forms of transformation are extension ( " active external manipulation , " p. 41 ) and intention ( " internal reflection , " p. 41 ) . Kolb specifically relates intention to introversion and extension to extraversion . <p> Kolb 's four styles are defined by the intersection of his two dimensions . Convergers favor abstract conceptualization and active experimentation while Divergers emphasize reflective observation and concrete experience . Accommodators value active experimentation and concrete experience , while Assimilators prefer abstract conceptualization and reflective observation . <p> Comparing his Learning Style Inventory ( LSI ) and the MBTI , Kolb ( 1976 ) noted " The strongest and most consistent relationships appear to be between concrete/abstract LSI and feeling/thinking MBTI and between active/reflective LSI and extrovert/introvert MBTI " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning styles relate to the extraverted and introverted aspects of the Thinking/Feeling scale . Lifescripts <p> The last measure considered is Christensen 's ( 1980 ) Lifescripts . Designed for use in management consulting , the scale defines four styles ( Analyzer , Controller , Supporter , and Promoter ) that Christensen relates to social interaction rather than cognitive functions . Nevertheless , the authors believe that such styles , as described as follows by Christensen , do , in fact , reflect cognitive variations in the way people use information whether they are in social situations or performing more clearly cognitive tasks . Moreover , we see definite parallels between this taxonomy and the Thinking/Feeling and **25;441;TOOLONG dimensions of the MBTI . <p> According to Christensen , " Controllers want results . They are very task oriented and will make sure the job gets done " ( p. 3 ) . They " ... like to direct and coordinate the work of others " ( p. 3 ) . Myers and Myers ( 1980 , p. 85 ) tell us that " Extraverted Thinkers use their thinking to run as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ; and " ... they enjoy deciding what ought to be done and giving appropriate orders to ensure that it will be done . " <p> Introverted Thinking types , like Analyzers , are logical and reserved . They " use their thinking to analyze the world , not run it " ( p. 89 ) . Extraverted Feeling types are friendly , tactful , sympathetic , and like dealing with people , while Promoters are described as gregarious , outgoing , and socially skillful . Introverted Feeling types are idealistic , loyal , and " value , above all , harmony " ( p. 97 ) . Supporters are also characterized as idealistic and loyal and " ... will try to keep conflict low in order to maintain harmony " ( Christensen , 1980 , p. 2 ) . <p> It should be noted that Lifescripts represents only one of a considerable number of style measures developed for consulting purposes ; cf. Life Orientations Survey ( Atkins , 1981 ) , The Self Profile ( DeVille , 1984 ) , and Social Style Profile ( Merrill &; Reid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be found in Bokoros ( 1989 ) . <p> We have considered five conceptual models of style relevant to cognition and noted their similarities ( see Tables 1 and 2 ) . We consider it significant that these pronounced similarities exist despite their differences in conceptual development , domains of application , specific item content and the response format of the measures . Jung based his typology upon observations made in the course of his clinical practice ; Gregorc and Kolb studied learning in the academic environment ; while Rowe and Christensen drew from work done in the industrial environment . <p> The similarity that exists among the systems suggests that the five measures may all be tapping into a single , consistent conceptual framework . Indeed , we hypothesize that a factor analysis of these five measures ( see also Table 3 ) will lead to the emergence of three factors : Factor 1 -- An executive cognitive function charged with controlling cognitive operations and arriving at decisions ; Factor 2 -- A receiving function ordering and encoding sensory input ; and Factor 3 -- An activating function determining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a close relationship with Factor 1 . <p> Finally , we believe that factors 1 and 2 operate along bipolar dimensions analogous to serial and parallel processing . METHOD <p> The instruments used in this study were the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator ( MBTI ) , the Learning Style Inventory ( LSI ) , the Gregorc Style Delineator ( GSD ) , the Decision Style Inventory ( DSI ) , and Lifescripts ( LFS ) . <p> The MBTI and LSI are relatively well-known instruments with documented psychometric integrity ( see Carlson , 1985 ; Carlyn , 1977 ; Myers and McCaulley , 1985 ; Thompson and Borello , 1986 , MBTI ; Freedman and Stumpf , 1978 ; Geller , 1978 ; Kolb , 1976 , 1981,1984 , LSI . ) Consequently , we will examine the latter three measures . <p> The GSD ( Gregorc , 1982a , 1982b ) presents the respondent with 10 sets of 4 words . In each set , the individual is asked to rank order the words in terms of how well they describe the respondent . Gregorc ( 1982b ) describes test-retest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construct validity ( positive correlations between GSD style types and endorsement of 40 characteristics theoretically consistent with the types ) ; nevertheless , the psychometric soundness of the GSD does not appear to be well-documented . <p> The Decision Style Inventory ( Rowe &; Mason , 1987 ) involves choosing from a set of four phrases the best ending to a sentence . Twenty sentences and word phrases are presented . Rowe ( Rowe &; Mason , 1987 ) reports significant split-half validity for his measure and reliable correlations between the DSI and other well-known measures- the MBTI , the LSI , and the Embedded Figures Test ( Witkin , Oltman , Raskin &; Karp , 1971 ) -but presents no actual data in his book . Finally , Christensen 's ( 1980 ) Lifescripts consists of 18 sentence completion items with four choices each to be ranked in order of how descriptive they are of the subject . The first six sentences are questions about a hypothetical autobiography ; the next six refer to a movie based on the book ; and the final six relate to critical responses ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no reported data on either the validity or reliability of the measure . <p> Although the last three measures do not have well-established reliability and validity , this does not present a particular difficulty in terms of the focus of our study , which is on the convergence of these measures . Indeed , the extent to which the measures are not psychometrically sound should just add random " noise " to the analysis and work against any convergence of factors . <p> The five measures were administered to 180 students and faculty members at Central Connecticut State University . One hundred and sixty-two of the subjects correctly completed all five measures . The data were then screened for outliers , skewness , and multivariate normality following procedures described by Tabatchnik and Fidell ( 1989 ) . The final sample of 143 individuals had a mean age of 32 years with a range of 17 to 72 . A variety of majors was reported , but most of the participants were from psychology , education , and business disciplines . <p> To prepare the data for factor analysis , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This transformation did not distort the meaning of the scales but allowed for more direct interpretation of the factor analysis in terms of the hypothesized factor alignment . For the MBTI , the dimensions were E/I S/N , T/F , J/P ( see Myers &; McCaulley , 1985 ) . On the LSI , we labeled CE - AC as LSI1 and AE - RO as LS12 . The dimensions of the GSD were defined as GSD1 = Abstract Random Abstract Sequential , and GSD2 = Concrete Random - Concrete Sequential , while for the DSI , dimensions were computed as DSI1 = Behavioral - Analytic , and DSI2 = Conceptual - Directive . <p> Computing continuous dimensions for Lifescripts was more complex since the instrument asked for responses under both normal and " adverse " conditions ( i.e. , negative reviews of the book and movie about their life ) . Since this division was not needed for our study , responses for a given item were combined into a single score for each type . The SP ( Supporter ) and PM ( Promoter ) scores were then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was obtained by combining AN ( Analyzer ) with CT ( Controller ) . Subtracting Task from People produced the scale , LFS1 , that we believe is associated with the MBTI 's T/F . The extraversion score ( CT + PM ) was subtracted from the introversion score ( AN + SP ) to obtain LFS2 . <p> The continuous scores were subjected to a principal factor analysis using varimax rotation ( SAS , 1985 ) . The specific factor alignment predicted is shown in Table 3 . RESULTS <p> A complete intercorrelation matrix of all variables is available from the authors . The pattern of correlations was generally consistent with predictions with the exception of the LSl 's AE and RO . Neither showed any meaningful association with Introversion or Extraversion . AE did show a small correlation with Sensation , and RO with Feeling . We also found that the GSD 's Sequential scores were significantly correlated with Introversion and the Random scores with Extraversion . <p> Kaiser 's Measure of Sampling Adequacy ( Kaiser , 1970 ) was 0.78 , exceeding the 0.6 threshold recommended by Tabatchnik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Three factors , which account for 100% of the common variance , were retained . The eigenvalues were : 3.163 , 1.670 , and 0.854 , respectively . The inclusion of the third factor with an eigenvalue less than one was based on inspection of the scree plot ( see Tabachnick &; Fidell , 1989 , p. 635 ) . The factor loadings after varimax rotation are shown in Table 4 . <p> Loadings exceeding 0.55 , Comrey 's ( 1973 ) criteria for " good " factors , are enclosed in parentheses . As can be seen , the alignment of the dimensions coincides very well with our theoretical predictions . DISCUSSION <p> The findings support our hypothesis in nearly every respect . Factor1 represents a decision-making function : convergent and objective at one pole ; divergent and subjective at the other . It appears to play a supervisory role in cognitive functioning . Factor2 represents a basic data-processing orientation : at one extreme immediacy , accuracy , and applicability ; at the other patterns and possibilities . Factor3 consists of the MBTI **25;468;TOOLONG scale and a similar scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to external stimuli or to one 's own thoughts and ideas . While Kolb 's theory approaches this factor from a purely cognitive standpoint ( as opposed to Christensen 's emphasis on the social environment ) his active/reflective dimension failed to load on this factor , or any other . This may reflect more on the instrument per se than on Kolb 's learning theory . In our opinion one end of his scale relates to pragmatism , rather than to activity , and the other end to a preference for passive learning , which is not necessarily reflective . <p> All of the instruments , including the LSI , load successfully on Factor1 , the decisionmaking dimension . Lifescripts combines this dimension with Factor3 ( Introversion/ Extraversion ) . The " social " styles defined by this instrument apparently reflect the internal and external application of the executive cognitive function . <p> The pattern of results is also consistent with certain neurophysiological data regarding brain functions . Luria ( 1966,1970,1973 ) , based on research into functional deficiencies resulting from localized brain damage , postulated three primary structures he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 66 ) . The first block ( brain stem , reticular formation , and hippocampus ) , relates principally to arousal ( see also Eysenck , 1967 ) ; the second block ( temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes ) deals with encoding of information ; while the third block ( frontal lobes ) is concerned with planning and decision-making . <p> The three blocks appear to have direct functional correspondence to the MBTI , i.e. , block one with **25;495;TOOLONG , block two with sensation/ intuition and block three with thinking/feeling . The remaining four models show parallels with two of the three blocks . Both Gregorc and Rowe describe functions related to encoding ( block two ) and decision-making ( block three ) while Kolb 's and Christensen 's measures both consider functions akin to attentional focus ( block one ) and decision making ( block three ) . <p> What are the implications of our results ? We believe that the convergence of the five instruments , containing in total 28 separate cognitive/behavioral indices , into three bipolar dimensions argues for the fundamentality of these dimensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual measures in their appropriate applications , a focus on the underlying cognitive processes may result in the development of new measures ( or the simplification of existing ones ! ) that have greatly expanded utility and applicability . Moreover , such research may inform neurophysiological work examining the chemical and biological bases of cognitive behavior . We believe that future psychometric research should examine the commonalities among psychological measures and their implications for underlying psychological processes rather than adding to the continued proliferation of instruments of limited applicability .

##4001474 No gender differences appeared in personality ratings of aggression/assertiveness when separate rating scales were used to rate extensive interview and test material on elderly women and men . Men were rated significantly lower in aggression on a scale created to rate women than on a scale created to rate men , and men tended to be rated as less aggressive than women on the female scale . For women , aggression was apparent in their accounts of current activities , while in men aggression was more often apparent in their renditions of past-life activities . Gender differences were most apparent in verbal aggression in interpersonal interactions . Findings are consistent with the possibility of age-related decline in aggression in men . <p> This study explored gender differences in old age in personality ratings of aggression/assertiveness along with patterns of apparent change in aggression from middle to old age . A perennial issue in adult development and aging is mean-level personality change from middle to old age , in which men become less , and women more , aggressive ( Turner , 1982 ) . Longitudinal research using objective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trait aggression ( Costa &; McCrae , 1980 ) , while research on self-concepts ( Bengtson , Reedy , &; Gordon , 1985 ) indicates more , and research using projective tests ( Gutmann , 1977 ) suggests still more , differential personality change in aggression for women and men . <p> In the present study , ratings of aggression were made from lengthy structured interviews and test materials . In this study , aggression is defined as action which is carried out in a forceful way to achieve ends . High aggression refers to a high level of assertiveness and goal-directedness to push toward a goal despite obstacles . A high level of hostility or overt anger does not necessarily indicate high assertiveness . At the low end of the scale , the individual is not assertive ; hostility may be suppressed or covertly expressed , but the individual is withdrawn and nonassertive ( Turner , 1969 , p. 123 ) . <p> When such data were initially analyzed , Turner ( 1969 ) created and used separate five-point scales for male and female respondents to rate aggression , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differed somewhat from those in women ; but , more important , examination of the interview and test protocols gave Turner the impression that men in this sample were , in general , less aggressive than women ( Turner , 1969 , p. 125 ) . Separate scales were created to control for these apparent gender differences , and , using the two separate scales , men and women did not differ in aggression . <p> But were the women in that sample indeed more aggressive than men ? To answer this question , men and women must be rated on the same scale . In the present , secondary analysis , aggression in male respondents was again rated , using the scale devised for rating women . Two comparisons were made . First , ratings of male respondents on the scale created in 1968 to rate men were compared to ratings of male respondents on the scale created in 1968 to rate women ; second , ratings of male respondents on the latter scale were compared to those of female respondents on the same scale . It was hypothesized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale than on the male scale , and that men would be rated as less aggressive than women when both genders were rated on the female scale . METHOD Sample <p> The sample consisted of 85 elderly Jewish persons ( 60 women and 25 men ) who were interviewed while on the waiting list for admission to one of three homes for the aged . The age range was 63-91 years old ( M = 78 years ) ; all respondents were born before the turn of the twentieth century . All respondents were ambulatory , free of major incapacitating illnesses , and showed no gross signs of altered brain function as defined by poor performance on several cognitive measures ( Turner , Tobin , &; Lieberman , 1972 ) . There were no gender differences in cognitive status ( Turner , 1969 ) or physical and functional capacity ( Tobin , 1990 ) . Data <p> A basic battery of instruments and focused interviews was administered to all respondents . This battery consisted of 18 structured instruments and 9 focused interview sections , administered in 4 to 6 sessions totalling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made six types of judgment on each respondent after completing the interview . <p> Turner ( 1969 ) developed a definition for the construct " aggression " and devised five-point scales to rate aggression as a personality trait in men and women separately ; scales were constructed to distribute the sample evenly among the five points . Scale points shown below were devised to rate women , and in the present analysis were used to rate both genders . <p> Scale point definitions for personality ratings of aggression used to rate women , and in 1990 , men also : Very Low Aggression . Respondent denies assertiveness in almost every instance , seeming instead to withdraw . Respondent seems unable to assert self , even in situations in which interpersonal conflict would not occur . Respondent may appear " helpless " or apathetic . Personal characteristics include : Respondent is a very quiet , compliant , unobtrusive person who places or has always placed others ' needs before own needs ; respondent represses own needs to propitiate others , is subservient ; Respondent is verbal and friendly to the interviewer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; is timid and fears own decisions , so defers to those of relatives , or " gives in " so as to avoid confrontations and denies anger or expresses helplessness ; and Respondent despairs of influencing others and has withdrawn , feels helpless . Respondent may seem actually afraid of the interviewer . Low Aggression . Respondent is generally a very mild person , but on occasion goes after things despite being most uncomfortable in situations involving interpersonal conflict . Or respondent seems never to go after things directly , but instead manipulates others in a passive fashion to supply needs . Respondent may use martyrdom and whining as weapons , but at the same time conveys impotence in influencing others and an inability to follow through in an assertive manner . Rather than mildness , respondent may convey strong anxiety with consequent withdrawing tendencies and a strong wish to avoid trouble that is then acted on . Moderate Aggression . Respondent is not particularly assertive , but focuses considerable hostility outward , so may angrily tell others off . Respondent has much potential for interpersonal conflict that is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very domineering in one or two relationships within the family circle , but is markedly fearful of ( and thus avoidant of , or deferent to ) nonfamily figures . Or , respondent 's aggressivity has a metered quality and is appropriately expressed ( but is not sufficiently intrusive/dominant to be rated a 4 ) . High Aggression . Respondent is very goal-directed in certain areas of life ; may be tough and argumentative , but is occasionally unsure of self and withdraws . Respondent is somewhat domineering ; or tends to assume leadership roles and actively assumes responsibility in social situations , but is not as intrusive/dominant as a 5 . Or , a mild , unobtrusive front covers an ability to assume control of people and social situations , so that respondent is strongly directive and powerful without seeming to be so . Very High Aggression . Respondent runs everything , takes over ; is a leader . Respondent may pop off unrestrainedly at every opportunity ; has a never-say-die attitude and is a formidable opponent . May manipulate people but in an active , commandeering , openly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an iron-willed dictator who compels deference . Respondent is instantly prepared to fight for own rights in almost any situation . Highly intrusive . <p> For the purpose of comparison , scale point definitions for personality ratings of aggression used to rate men in 1968 are shown below . The scale point definitions for personality ratings of aggression used to rate men in 1968 were : Very Low Ageression . Respondent may be extroverted or very quiet , but in either case he expresses impotence and helplessness in interpersonal conflicts ; e.g. , if his child says something mean to him , he cries , or feels he must " take it . " The interviewer may remark that he is especially mild-mannered , passive , and subservient . He is " broken . " He has a strong self-image of noncompetitiveness and unobtrusiveness ; he views himself as a man who " never argues . " Low Aggression . Respondent seems to do his very best to avoid conflict , but irritation slips through . He may be apathetic and humble but manipulates others . In his job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have an " underdog " air . Moderate Aggression . Respondent is easily irritated , agitated , and negativistic , but he deals with these feelings by isolating himself . He is a quiet man , but he has a stubborn streak . At present , he seems to be a quiet , even a passive man , but in earlier life he seemed to display decided masculine-assertive characteristics ; e.g. , he reveled in his superordinate position as foreman in which he directed the work of many other men ; or he once loved to participate in competitive sports . In general , he has a potential for conflict although he prefers to avoid it . High Aggression . Respondent was quite competitive in his business and took on many organizational activities and responsibilities . Often he has been a " doer " and still tries to control others . He is occasionally quite irascible , or he may be an egotist who persistently seeks to be the center of attention . Although he may express some timidity about crossing others , he will stand up for his rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verbally aggressive or is quarrelsome and maintains a masculine-aggressive pose ; he is forceful and may even be physically aggressive , or he was when younger . He was , and still tries to be , dominant over others . Or , he is an egotist who takes on organizational responsibilities as well as relentlessly seeking a limelight . RESULTS <p> The mean score for women on the rating scale for aggression created in 1968 for rating women , M = 2.98 , SD = 1.44 , was almost identical to the mean score for men on the rating scale created in 1968 for rating aggression in men , M = 3.0O , SD = 1.26 . A second rater , unaware of the specific hypotheses of this study , rated 13 female and 18 male protocols on the female and male scales , respectively ; interjudge reliability ( product-moment correlations ) for female cases was .86 and for male cases , .93 . <p> Next , all 25 male cases were rated on the aggression scale created for rating women , M = 2.44 , SD = 1.00 . Interjudge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale was .95 . Thirteen of the 25 men ( 52% ) were rated as less aggressive on this scale than they were rated on the scale for men . No men were rated as more aggressive on the female scale than on the male scale . It should be noted that 4 of the 25 men had received the lowest possible rating on aggression on the male scale , and therefore could be rated no lower on the female scale . Hence , of the 21 men who might have been rated lower on the female than on the male scale , 62% ( n = 13 ) were so rated . Men were rated as significantly less aggressive on the female scale than they were on the male scale , t(24) = 4.80 , p <.001 . <p> Finally , ratings of men and women were compared on the scale created for rating women . On the aggression scale devised for rating women , men ( M = 2.44 ) tended to be rated as less aggressive than were women , M = 2.98 , t(83) = 1.71 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this study provide partial support for the hypothesis that men ( in this sample of Jewish elderly ) were less aggressive than women . Although half of the men were rated as less aggressive on the scale created for rating women than they were on the scale devised for rating men , and although this difference is significant , mean ratings for the two genders on the female scale failed to reach significance at the .05 level . <p> Gender differences were especially apparent above the midpoint of the scale . Twenty percent of the women , but none of the men , received the highest rating ( 5 ) on the female scale . Analysis indicated that , for women , the presence or absence of forceful goal-directed action was generally apparent in their accounts of current activities . For men , in contrast , the presence of forceful action was more often rated on the basis of their renditions of past-life , especially occupational activities . Occupational life and , for some , organizational activities and competitive sports , provided the context for male assertiveness . Organizational activities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context for highly assertive women , but gender differences were particularly apparent in the expression of verbal assertiveness in interpersonal situations . Among men , verbal aggression often appeared as irritability ; assertive women , in contrast , were more zestfully direct in verbal aggression and more forceful in their attempts to achieve their goals in interpersonal contexts . These gender differences in the expression of aggression were not accounted for by differences in physical status ; the women and men in this sample were comparable in health status ( Tobin , 1990 ) . The gender differences in manifestations of aggression in this study are similar to the gender differences in expression of ego mastery style found in projective test responses of elderly . Gutmann ( 1964 ) reported that women tended to view conflicts as interpersonal , or deployed aggression directly , while men were more likely to struggle against an impersonal environment , or were unable to act instrumentally to reach their goals . <p> These data are cross-sectional , and it can not unambiguously be concluded that the men in this sample are less aggressive than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , with such an interpretation . The mechanism for such a change , if it occurs , remains unclear in these data . Gutmann 's socioevolutionary model ( 1977,1987 ) is the most comprehensive approach to gender differentiation across the life span in personality traits such as aggression ( Huyck , 1990 ) . Gutmann has proposed that aggression in younger men has evolved in response to the demands of parenting ; when the offspring are no longer vulnerable and in need of support , men are free to become less aggressive . <p> Another suggestion is that occupational life provides a normative context for male aggression across many cohorts in our society , such that assertiveness dwindles when the occupational context is unavailable to men in old age . Intimate interactions , in contrast , form the normative context for female aggression , at least among the elderly cohorts thus far studied . Aggression , in other words , may be somewhat situation-specific for each gender . In this sample , however , assertive old women were more likely to be directly aggressive in public " impersonal " contexts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men were in " private " interpersonal interactions . <p> The findings of this study are consistent , then , with the possibility of age-related decline in aggression in men . It also appears that the old men studied are indeed somewhat less aggressive than are the old women , at least when aggression , defined as forceful goal-directed action , is rated from extensive interview and test materials . ( In contrast , studies using objective personality tests such as the Guildford-Zimmerman Temperament Survey find large gender differences in the expected direction on masculine-associated scales Costa , McCrae , &; Arenberg , 1983 ) . <p> Because aggression in women in this study was readily rated on the basis of current activities , there is no way of estimating stability or change in level of aggression among women . Whether women increase in aggression from middle to old age remains an open question in these data . <p> 
##4001476 A three-alternative forced choice forward masking procedure was embedded in an arcade-style rocketship video game . Human subjects were categorized into five groups adults and 5- , 6- , 7- , and 8-year-old children . The masker was a 500-msec noise that simulated rocket engines and the 20-msec , 500-Hz sinusoidal signal was a chirp from a gremlin . The gremlin hid , at random , in one of the three rockets . Subjects responded and interacted with the game by touching the rocket hiding the gremlin . Results revealed that masked thresholds decreased for all groups as a function of the interstimulus interval . The reliability of the psychophysical approach was confirmed and a developmental trend lends support to the hypothesis that auditory processing improves as a function of age . Children 's auditory filters were suggested to be functionally larger than those of adults . <p> A child 's perception of the world , like everyone 's , is a function of experience and innate sensory abilities . In this respect important and fundamental questions exist concerning a child 's sensory competence . It is well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young child can lead to permanent perceptual impairment if the defect is not recognized and corrected . As a result , the need to evaluate and understand a child 's visual capability is important . Likewise , the auditory modality is a vital and significant window to the world . Indeed , normal hearing mechanisms are clearly functional well before birth and are vital to normal speech development ( e.g. , Bredberg , 1968 ; DeCasper and Fifer , 1980 ; Elliott et al. , 1979 ; Morrongiello , Kulig , &; Clifton , 1984 ) . <p> The present paper examines an essential auditory parameter , temporal processing , using young children . The choice of time as the variable of interest , rather than frequency or intensity , was based on intuition as well as empirical data . Investigators of infant and child hearing have labored diligently to provide important contributions to the development of frequency and intensity processing ( e.g. , Allen , Wightman , Kistler , &; Dolan , 1989 ; Aslin , 1989 ; Davis &; McCroskey , 1980 ; Irwin , Ball , Kay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , &; Schade , 1986 ; Jensen , 1987 ; Morrongiello &; Trehub , 1987 ; Morrongiello , Kulig , &; Clifton , 1984 ; Nossa &; Wilson , -1984 ; Olsho , 1985 ; Soderquist &; Hoenigman , 1973 ; Soderquist &; Moore , 1970 ; Thorpe , Trehub , Morrongiello , &; Bull , 1988 ) . There is , however , no doubt that temporal patterns within acoustic events are equally vital to the normal unfolding of language , speech , and musical perception ( e.g. , Bailey , 1983 ; Elliott et al. , 1979 ; Elliott , Hammer , Scholl , &; Wasowicz , 1989 ; Nossa , Rossman , Bond , &; Miller , 1990 ; Studdert-Kennedy , 1975 ; Tallal , Stark , Kallman , &; Mellits , 1981 ; Trehub , 1987 ; Wightman , Allen , Dolan , Kistler , &; Jamieson , 1989 ) . Investigations that focus on the temporal parameter , use convergent methods , and control subject variability should generate significant information regarding auditory development in children . Our initial goal in this project was to investigate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a forward-masking paradigm . <p> Aside from the problem of children 's variability within psychophysical tasks ( which is addressed below ) , we were concerned about the development of the auditory system . We hypothesized that a child 's performance in a forward-masking task would be inferior to that of an adult . This is because recent data show that children 's auditory filters are larger than those of adults ( e.g. , Irwin et al. , 1986 ) . If the auditory filters are larger , they would be less efficient and less selective in funneling-out and removing extraneous sounds . The predicted result would be that children would have higher masked thresholds because of the decreased signal-to-noise ratio concomitant with large auditory filters . Signal detectability decreases as a function of increasing filter size ( the filter passes more noise and decreases the S/N ratio ) . When the temporal domain is examined , as in forward masking , one would expect the signal to be less detectable for children with large auditory filters . Further , one would expect that children of different ages would perform differently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Young children with large filters would be expected to have higher masked thresholds than older children and adults . Further , the functions should vary systematically as the interstimulus interval changes . These conjectures were examined in the present study . <p> The use of children in behavioral psychophysical tasks raises interesting and complex questions . It is well known that psychophysical tasks necessitate focused attention and careful following of verbal instructions . It is equally clear that one often encounters difficulties when young children are requested to be careful psychophysical observers . Some of the more obvious impediments are motivation , attention , restlessness , and just plain boredom . A request to sit quietly in a sound attenuated booth , push buttons , and attend to weird noise bursts and/or tone pips over earphones is not a child 's idea of fun . Under such conditions a child quickly becomes bored , disinterested , and inattentive to monotonous repetitive stimuli . If no effort is made to maintain a recalcitrant child 's curiosity and interest in the task , the data collected during even a short experimental session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish the task ! ) . To overcome this obstacle an experimental technique has been developed , both in our laboratory and others ( e.g. , Abramov et al. , 1984 ; Allen et al. , 1989 ; Hall &; Grose , 1990 ; Jensen , Neff , &; Callaghan , 1987 ; Wightman et al. , 1989 ) , where a psychophysical technique is embedded within a computerized video game . This innovation allows investigators to focus on primary auditory processes while maintaining the child 's cooperation . The introduction of a touch screen system to replace button presses also appears to be a useful innovation . <p> There are several approaches to the investigation of auditory perception via the temporal parameter. 1 The rapid temporal shifts within the flow of fluent speech suggest forward masking as one promising avenue . The detection of a signal that is preceded by a masker is , in part , a function of the interstimulus interval ( ISI ) between the two stimuli ( Elliott , 1962 , 1971 ; Soderquist , Carstens , &; Frank , 1981 ) . Using forward masking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability of a subject to detect a brief signal following a masker . METHODS Subjects <p> There were 25 subjects categorized into five equal sized age groups : 5 through 8 , and adults . Each subject had normal hearing and was examined by the University Speech and Hearing Center . Children were recruited from local day care centers and elementary schools . Adults were selected from faculty and students at the University . Brief Illustrative Procedure <p> On the day of the " game " the child was brought to the Auditory Perception Laboratory . Upon arrival he or she was shown toys and prizes that could be won by playing the game . After a short acclimation period , the child was allowed to enter the " game room " with one of the research assistants . The child sat at a table within the room . The child 's monitor , and a similar one outside the room for the experimenter , were interfaced with a microcomputer and a touch screen system . When the child entered the room , an introductory logo was on the screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " danced and " chirped " ( Figure 1a ) . The child and the research assistant put on matching earphones and listened to the gremlin while the instructions for the game were explained . Once the child understood the goal of the game , i.e. , to find the gremlin hiding in one of the rocketships , a practice game would begin . The game would start when the child touched the gremlin displayed on the monitor . When the game began , the visual image changed to that of three rocketships resting on launch pads . The child could hear each rocketship , in sequence , " test its engines " ( a noise burst ) . As each rocketship tested its engines , red flames would emanate from the rocket simultaneously with the noise burst ( Figure 1b ) . On each trial the gremlin would signal its hiding place by providing a chirp ( the signal ) immediately following one of the three noise bursts . Using the chirp as a cue , the child 's task was to touch the rocketship containing the gremlin ( Figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increment in the score shown on the screen and the emergence of the gremlin from the top of the rocket ( Figure 1d ) . The gremlin would chirp and zig-zag upward into the sky until , near the top of the screen , it would be vaporized with a laser beam and disappear with a bang ( the backfire of a Model-T Ford , near 60 dB SPL ) ( Figure 1e ) . If the subject made an error , the gremlin would appear briefly below the correct rocketship , dance , chirp three times and disappear ( Figure 1f ) . The game continued in this manner until the threshold for the signal was estimated by the 3AFC adaptive procedure ( Levitt , 1971 ) . At the completion of each game the rocketship would blast off for a new planet , the point total would appear , and a brief rest period was introduced . Each game lasted approximately 3 to 4 minutes and averaged approximately 30-35 trials . Following the practice game , the experiment would begin and the child would play three games at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between games . With older children , the assistant often left the game room and the child played alone . In situations where the assistant remained in the room , he or she removed the earphones and sat silently behind or to the side of the subject . The subject 's performance was , in all cases , monitored via a one-way mirror . Adults played the same game and had the same practice . Apparatus and Stimuli <p> Each subject was seated in front of a Zenith VGA Multi-Sync monitor inside a double-walled chamber . Auditory stimuli were presented via matched earphones ( TDH-49 in supraural cushions ) . The video game was produced using Borland Turbo Pascal 4.0 and subject responses were recorded via an Elographics Touch Screen and controller . The signal was a digitally generated 500-Hz sinusoid using a sampling frequency of 25 kHz . The signal was converted by a Data Translations 2801-A D/A converter . The rise/fall of the signal ( the gremlin chirp ) was 5 msec . The total duration of the signal was 20 msec . The 500-msec analog noise , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precision noise generator bandpassed ( 10-3kHz at 3 dB down ) through a 24 dB/oct Krohn-Hite 3100 adjustable filter . The noise spectrum level ( No ) was approximately 38 dB ( 73 dB SPL overall ) . The stimuli were mixed , amplified . and controlled using Coulbourn Instruments mixer/amplifiers ( S8224 ) , Coulbourn Instruments programmable attenuators ( S85-08 ) , and a Crown D-75 amplifier . Stimuli were monitored using a Tektronix storage scope ( SAISN amplifier and SL4N spectrum analyzer ) , Ballantine 320A true RMS meter , and Hewlett-Packard manual attenuators ( 350-D ) . Psychophysical procedure <p> A three-alternative forced choice psychophysical procedure ( 3AFC ) using a 2-down/ 1-up Levitt ( 1971 ) adaptive algorithm was embedded into the previously described video game . The algorithm provided a 71% correct detection at the masked threshold . <p> The interval between noise bursts ( inter-rocket interval ) was 500 msec . The interval between the noise offset and the signal onset ( ISI ) was either 10 , 30 , or 100 msec for each game . On each trial the 20-msec signal followed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The subject indicated their decision by touching the rocket where the gremlin was thought to be hiding . The signal level varied according to the 2-down/1-up algorithm ( Levitt , 1971 ) . If the subject made two consecutive correct responses , the signal intensity decreased . The signal level increased for each incorrect response . An individual game was terminated after eight turn-arounds . A turn-around occurred whenever the signal intensity changed from increasing to decreasing , or vice-versa . The signal level changed in 4-dB steps for the first three turn-arounds and in 2-dB steps thereafter . The masked threshold for each game was based on the signal intensity at each of the last five turn-arounds . The final datum , for each ISI , was obtained by deriving the mean from the thresholds of three consecutive games . The order of ISI was counterbalanced as much as possible across subjects . The signal intensity for the first game was always at 60-dB SPL . The beginning signal level for the following two games was determined by randomly adding between 10 to 19 dB to the signal threshold obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 , and 4 show , for representative subjects , signal level as a function of trial number . Figure 2 displays the results for a 5-year-old in the left column , and a 6-year-old on the right . Figure 3 shows data for the 7- and 8-year-old groups . Figure 4 shows the performance of two adults . Each column displays three games at each of the three different ISIs . The Mean ( M ) and Standard Error ( SE ) , calculated across games , are indicated within each panel . As is evident from the figures , the performance of the subjects was similar regardless of age . That is , there was a systematic decrease in signal level across trials . Once the masked threshold was approached the subjects tracked the signal to the end of the game ; viz. , the eighth turn-around . Also , as can be seen from the figures , the within subject variability ( SE ) was quite small and differed little as a function of age . This latter result reflects the reliability of the subject 's performance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mean masked threshold is plotted as a function of ISI . The standard error shown below each ISI indicate the presence of individual differences across subjects . The mean threshold , in all but four instances , decreases as a function of increasing ISI . In addition , the standard error for adults , at each ISI , is smaller than the standard error for children . The single exception is the 10-msec ISI for the 6-year-olds . <p> Figure 6 shows the mean-masked thresholds ( top panel ) and the best data ( lower panel ) for each group . In the former case each data point was determined by averaging across all subjects and all games . In the best data condition only a subject 's best game was used in the calculation . The best game was defined as the one that yielded the lowest masked threshold . The figure shows clearly that age affects task performance . The younger the child the higher the masked threshold . Two mixed design ANOVAs revealed significant main effects for age and ISI ( p < .001 ) for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A significant Age X ISI interaction ( p < .02 ) occurred for the Mean Data but not the Best Data ( p > .35 ) . The Greenhouse-Geisser correction for df was applied where appropriate . Bonferroni post-hoc tests showed that , in both sets of data , the adult means were significantly lower ( p < .05 ) than those of the children at all ISI values . DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS <p> The data support the conclusion that the rocketship video game reduces the within-subject variability often reported when young children are used in psychophysical experiments . One of the most striking features of the technique , aside from the video game itself , was the introduction of the touch screen for the subject 's response . The children specifically enjoyed interacting with the game by touching the rocketship which hid the gremlin . The immediate recording of the correct response and the attempted escape by the gremlin ( and its subsequent demise ) appeared to be important feedback for the child and the success of the technique . The interactive mode provided by the touch screen was most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although button pressing had been used as a response mechanism for some of the older children at the outset of the project , the change to the touch screen activity , in conjunction with the inherently interesting gremlin rocketship video game , increased the children 's attention span , interest , and motivation to the level where even the younger children responded like adults ( e.g. , Figures 2 through 4 ) . That is , their data were reliable and systematic as they tracked the signal . In addition , they had relatively small standard errors both within a game as well as between games . The possible exception to this was the 5-year-olds . Not all 5-year-old children could learn to associate the gremlin chirp with the rocketship hiding the gremlin . Approximately 40-50% of the children at this age had difficulty and could not do the task after one practice game . Older children were all successful and played the game with no difficulty . <p> The data on the forward masking ( Figure 6 ) show clear and significant differences among the groups . The noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The younger the child the more effective the noise was in masking the signal . A plausible explanation is suggested by the rather remarkable similarity among the groups . The mean thresholds shifted downward systematically as age increased . This outcome suggests a single underlying factor associated with the differences in performance across groups . This factor , we believe , is the functional width of the auditory filter centered at the signal frequency . If the filter were larger in young children and decreased as a function of age , as suggested by other investigators ( e.g. , Irwin et al. , 1986 ) , then the present results are easily interpreted . The wider filters , at young ages , permit more noise to enter the auditory system and mask the signal . As the child grows older these functional filters decrease in width , are more selective , and simultaneously restrict the amount of noise entering the system . The reduction in noise at these older ages yields a lower masked threshold and parallel functions . <p> Finally , it is worth noting that even though the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age 8 , there are significant differences between a child 's performance and that of an adult . First , it appears that , if the performance is indeed dependent upon the auditory filter width , the auditory filters have not reached their adult level by the age of 8 . Second , the between-subject variability was , in nearly all cases , larger for children . This outcome also suggests that children 's perceptual systems are still developing through 8 years of age . Moreover , the rate of development appears to vary widely ( Figure 5 ) . The data show , for example , that some of the younger children performed the perceptual task as well as children 2 years older . Large individual differences , however , are expected during the course of development . The critical factors for our purposes were the low within subject variance and the steady improvement in performance as a function of age . <p> 
##4001553 Maria Montessori ( 1870-1952 ) , the Italian physician turned educational theorist , espoused a form of education for young children that considered them in their entirety -- spirit , mind , and heart . Today , such education is called " holistic " and stands as a counterpoise to the kind of experience typically offered children in American schools ( J. Miller 1988 ; R. Miller 1990 ) . The holistic worldview is essentially a spiritual , rather than a materialistic , one . It prizes such tuner human qualities as mind , emotion , creativity , imagination , compassion , a sense of wonder , reverence , and the urge for self realization , recognizing these as vital aspects of human existence ( R. Miller 1990 , 58 ) . <p> Montessori 's view of the child is that of a human person creatively unfolding from within . " We know , " she says , " how to find pearls in the shells of oysters , gold in the mountains and coal in the bowels of the earth , but we are unaware of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he enters this world to renew mankind " ( 1970,240 ) . Montessori sees spiritual powers as a form of wealth that must go into circulation so that others can enjoy them , wealth that must be expressed and utilized ( 1970,140 ) . <p> As a young , enthusiastic educational reformer , Montessori agreed with Frederick Froebel 's view of education , to which she owed much : " By education , then , the divine essence of man should be unfolded , brought out , lifted into consciousness , and man himself reused into free , conscious obedience to the divine principle that lives in him , and to a free representation of this principle in his life " ( 1970,4 ) . Montessori 's agreement with Froebel stemmed from both her Roman Catholic belief in human transcendence and her clinical observations of young children . <p> Montessori 's life-long perception of her work as " scientific pedagogy " and her apparent need to have it considered as exclusively " scientific , " rather than as partially emanating from an intuitive or ideological source , strongly influenced the language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at the end of her life , especially in her books , The Absorbent Mind ( 1967 ) and The Child in The Family ( 1970 ) ( both posthumously published ) , she clearly indicated her method 's alt encompassing inspiration . <p> As an old , wise , and revered sage , interned in India during World War II , Montessori revisited her earliest educational views and restated them in language congenial to her audience . Together with Krishnamurti , Montessori believed that the right kind of education cultivates one 's whole being and with Gandhi , that " unless the development of the mind and body goes hand in hand with a corresponding awakening of the soul , the former alone would prove to be a poor lopsided affair " ( 1970,138 ) . <p> For Montessori , education is a " help to life . " It transcends the narrow limits of direct instruction and direct transmission of knowledge from one mind to another . Montessori 's focus was on the " preparation of the environment , " the key to her idea of education from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exert through children has the environment as its instrument , for the child absorbs his environment , takes everything from it , and incarnates it in himself " ( 1970,66 ) . Montessori deplored the universally limited perception of education as an education merely of the mind . " If education is always to be conceived along the same antiquated Line of a mere transmission , there is little hope from it in the bettering of man 's future . If help and salvation are to come , they can only come from the children , for the children are the makers of men " ( 1970,4 ) . <p> Montessori sees education as a help to the unfolding of the child 's inborn psychic powers . She , through her method , proposes to unleash the constructive energy of the child , which she maintains has returned unnoticed for thousands of years . Using as an example the facility with which every child acquires his or her language of origin , Montessori finds within every child a painstaking teacher . " The only language men ever speak perfectly is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach them anything " ( 1970,6 ) . Montessori sees the teacher 's task as " not to talk " but to prepare and arrange a series of motives for cultural activity within an environment especially designed for the young child . The child 's education is not acquired by listening to the teacher 's words but by virtue of experiences in which the child acts on his environment . Forty years of experience with young children in many countries persuaded Montessori that the child 's individual activity was the one factor that stimulated and produced development ( 1970,8 ) . " We teachers can only help the work going on , as servants wait upon a master . We then become witnesses to the development of the human soul " ( 1970,9 ) . <p> Montessori sees the traditional credit given parents , especially mothers , for the formation of the child as a major obstacle to understanding the child 's inner powers . " We used to say that it was the mother who formed the child ; for it is she who teaches him to walk , talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done by the mother . It is an achievement of the child . What the mother brings forth is the baby , but it is the baby who produces the man " ( 1970,16 ) . Montessori reserves a particularly harsh judgment for authoritarian parents bent on replicating themselves in their children . She saw the reactions of the young children in her schools , where youngsters ' repressed spirits expanded and revealed themselves , as an indication of the serious child-rearing errors committed in the past . She described the children in her schools as tranquil , absorbed , and intensely interested in their work , achieving an amazing level of serenity . " Evidently , our students ' natural spontaneity , which derives mysteriously from the child 's inner life , had long been suppressed by the energetic and inopportune intervention of adults , who believe they can do everything better than children , substituting their own activities for those of the children and forcing them to submit their will and initiative to adult control " ( 1970,10-11 ) . <p> Children who live in a world created by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs . Montessori sees virtually all child rearing and education pervaded by the notion of adaptation of the child to the adult world , adaptation based upon an unquestioning obedience , " which leads to the negation of the child 's personality " ( 1970,12 ) . Her solution to the problem is to create for young children an adaptive environment different from the ones in which children typically operate and that have already formed their characters . " The implementation of any educational system ought to begin with the creation of an environment that protects the child from the difficult and dangerous obstacles that threaten him in the adult world . The shelter in the storm , the oasis in the desert , the place of spiritual rest ought to be created in the world precisely to assure the healthy development of the child " ( 1970,13 ) . <p> Montessori argues for the child as a separate being , rather than as an extension of parents or as an appendage of family . " The child as a separate entity , with different needs to satisfy in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into consideration " ( 1970,15 ) . Montessori exhorts parents , politicians , and educators to join forces in their respect and help for the " construction work the human soul is called upon to do , a work of formation which brings out the immense potentialities with which children , the sons of men , are endowed " ( 1970,17 ) . <p> Montessori 's explanation of the child 's immediate postnatal development is as a " spiritual embryo . " Just as the prenatal period has done its formative work in the physical sphere , so the formative work of the postnatal period is to make the baby into a kind of " spiritual embryo . " Unlike infra-human species , only man has this double embryonic life characterized by his prolonged infancy . " If the work of man on the earth is related to his spirit , to his creative intelligence , then his spirit and his intelligence must be the fulcrum of his existence , and of all the workings of his body . About this fulcrum his behavior is organized , and even his physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual halo " ( 1970,61 ) . <p> If it is , as she believes , the nature of man be ruled by an enfolding spiritual halo , then , Montessori maintains , the care given the newborn must be care transcending bodily needs . The ability of newborns to absorb everything around them directly dictates the design of a particular environment for them . " The child has a different relation to his environment from ours . Adults admire their environment ; they can remember it and think about it ; but the child absorbs it . The things he sees are not just remembered ; they form pan of his soul , He incarnates in himself all in the world about him that his eyes see and his ears hear . In us the same things produce no change , but the child is transformed by them " ( 1970,62 ) . <p> Montessori underscores the immense influence that education , in the guise of a " prepared " environment , can exert on newborns. gifted as they are , with a capacity for incarnation . This environment has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Children are born with a vital force already present in general structure of the absorbent mind . This structure changes throughout their early life in response to growth and psychic development , as well as to their interactions with the environment . <p> Montessori envisions as the steward of the child 's emergent spirit a parent or teacher with faith that children , if allowed , will epiphanize their true selves . " Our schools , " she says , " offer the tinies ( two and three year olds ) a sheltering refuge in which the first elements of character can take shape " ( 1970,222 ) . The teacher is the keeper and custodian of the environment and an exemplar of non-intrusive behavior . " Although the relationship between the child and teacher is in the spiritual field , the teacher can find a very good model for her behavior in the way a good valet looks after his master . ... He serves his meals , but does not oblige his master to eat . ... So we must behave when the child 's spirit is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child 's spirit " ( 1970,281 ) . <p> Helping children act , will , and think for themselves is at the heart of Montessori 's " method . " In an environment responsive to their true needs , children acquire physical independence by being self-sufficient . They become of independent will by using the power of choice . They become capable of independent thought by working alone without interruption . In all of this , the adult 's contribution to children is to serve their spirits . <p> 
##4001557 In the beginning there was Spider Woman , she who was called Thought Woman . At the dawn of being , Spider Woman spun a line from North to South , and another from East to West . She sat by these threads that stretched to the four horizons , which she had drawn across the universe , and she sang . As she sang two daughters came forth : Ut Set , who became the mother of the Pueblo people , and Nau Ut Set , who became the mother of all others . On all her daughters ' children Spider Woman placed a covering of creative wisdom , spun from her own spider being . To each she attached a thread of her web . It is for this reason that each person has a delicate thread connected to Spider Woman , connected through a doorway in the top of the skull . We chant to keep the doorway open . <p> Many forget the door . They grow cruel and corrupt . Only those who remember to keep the door open , to draw open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel . They can see and feel the thread that is their part of the web of destiny that Spider Woman weaves . -- Keres Pueblo creation myth adapted from Ancient Mirrors of Womanhood by Merlin Stone <p> <p> Narratives concerning the origin , nature , and functioning of the world provide a container within which the individual develops a particular relationship to experience . That container helps to delineate the boundaries of consciousness for both the individual and the group . As Paula Gunn Allen says in her recent book Grandmothers of the Light ( 1991,229 ) , " Thought Woman spins her web of dreams , thinks us into being , dances us into existence . As she thinks , so we are . " This article examines the thesis that , as the gods or goddesses of creation think , so the individual is . Cosmology , that aspect of a culture 's mythology that defines the origin and nature of the universe , reflects psychology ; the culture 's image of the cosmos is mirrored in the structure of the individual psyche . My use of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layers of the self , particularly the relationship between ego and the unconscious . <p> This is not to imply a direct cause and effect relationship between the structure of the psyche and cosmological narrative . That in itself would be an attempt to force a complex nonlinear reality into a linear form . Cultural and clinical observations imply that cosmology and psyche do not interact in a specifically predictable , diagrammable way . The relationship between psyche and cosmology seems to be that of an interactional field , a series of reflections connected in a web of facets , many of which can not be addressed in this discussion and some of which are unknown to us . This field filters perception and guides the assignment of value and meaning , shaping the experience of reality . Accessing a nonlinear reality is difficult with linear , cognitive tools . The rationally oriented ego must adjust to tracking visible aspects of this web in order to gain clues concerning its nature . This process is somewhat like following the trails of atomic particles in a cloud chamber . The object of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deduce certain of its characteristics from its visible effects . <p> One visible effect of the multilayered field is cosmological narrative . These narratives are constructs of reality that include metastories concerning the creation of the world and the way the world functions ; tales of the nature of a particular human group and its place and function in that world ; and individual life stories of origin , purpose , and relationship to the whole . The scope of normal awareness and the limits of perception can to a certain extent to be charted or envisioned by building a picture of individual or group cosmology . An exploration of the cosmological stories of Western science illustrates this relationship and reveals psychological implications concerning the experience of mystery and rationality . In contrast , the cosmology of the Spider Woman stories presents a different perception of reality . <p> Spider Woman , as a Goddess of creation , evokes a universe in which tangible and intangible realities overlap ; human beings exist in both layers . The cosmology of the Keres Pueblo provides a container within which the individual can maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of destiny . Enactment of a ritual round of ceremony connects the community and its members to the mythic universe of mystery , the ground of being . A cycle of stories describes the mythic world as an integral part of the " real " world and conveys , through narrative , relationships among the cohabitants of a multilayered universe ( Gunn Allen 1991 ) . Attention and participation will bring the individual to awareness of his or her connection to the cosmos , a weblike interconnection that permanently exists , although it might be " forgotten . " Mystery is a natural , even nourishing aspect of existence , conveyed through story and image as both immanent and transcendent , ineffable but deeply felt , the source of meaning and inspiration . This creation story portrays a metaphysical ground of being much like the Hindu picture of Brahman , " the life force of the universe which secretly dwells in all things , " as the Upanishadsjung describes it . How do these images compare to those of Western cosmology ? <p> Some mythic traditions of the Western world offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gateways to mystery , but the common practice of secular life in Western culture excludes a personal connection to the ground of being . The dominant worldview attempts to define the universe , its inhabitants , and their relationships through a scientistic methodology that explicitly excludes the existence of mystery . This cosmological structure constitutes a secular myth which states that the cosmos is entirely subject to rational explanation , if only one has sufficient data . <p> Thus the prevailing cosmology of America has gone beyond the worldview of the patriarchal monotheisms . The Genesis God of creation forms a world in which the individual is born out of connection to the ground of being but , through the careful following of rules , may gain a hierarchical relationship to the source of creation ( Campbell 1968 ) . Received secular wisdom depicts instead a cosmos to which one can relate only through the medium of rational understanding . The God of creation in this cosmology is rational cause and effect , and the ground of being has all but disappeared from conscious perception . <p> Within this worldview the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have explained and that which we are in the process of researching . As a pragmatically enlightened people , we travel down the linear road of time , acquiring knowledge of and therefore mastery of a fundamentally mechanistic cosmos in which human cognition is the essence of awareness . Insights that question the primacy of linear understanding , such as chaos theory or the delineation of the unconscious , are regularly reworked so that they appear to support the quest for a fully rational explanation of the universe . All those aspects of the universe and the human being that are not particularly amenable to rational analysis assume nonreality . And thus the cosmos is split . One can not experience any valid relationship to the mysterious ground of being , because mystery itself is merely a misperception springing from inadequate research . We " limit the definition of reality to the body of theoretical and empirical knowledge at our disposal and declare as meaningless all questions about the actual nature of systems " ( Keller 1985 , 147 ) . Experiences and inquiries that resist the process of linear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual . <p> How are nonrational experiences relegated to shadow ? Most commonly , society or culture , particularly patriarchal culture , is spoken of as a sort of force that somehow controls the individual 's perceptions and creates shadow . The image is of culture as an external power whose influence can perhaps be eliminated by the individual through insight and the adoption of new rules for thinking and living ( as with political correctness ) . Such efforts are frequently ineffective . People raised within the Western worldview mirror the cosmological split of the culture in the structure of their psyches . They must work with the " real but unknown " ( Jung 1966 ) aspects of self in order to effect a change in how reality is experienced . Intellectual decisions are inadequate for this level of change . <p> How is the split cosmos of Western culture reflected in the individual psyche ? Conscious and unconscious aspects of the psyche are strictly separated . The standard ego in this configuration is the ultimate rationalistic arbiter of reality itself , the personality 's scientist attempting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . Internal and external experiences that can not be molded to the ego 's grasp can only reside in the unconscious . Ego strength is directly opposed to that archetypal , nonlinear world of mystery that is without boundaries . Thus , it lives in the unconscious . Flexibility in the separation of ego and unconscious is synonymous with inaccurate perception , if not delusion . <p> In the typical individual only severe trauma or neurological imbalance will prevent the structure of the psyche from being formed by the time adulthood is reached . From that point , perception is determined by the boundaries of the ego and the relationship between ego and unconscious . Jung ( 1966 ) thought that the ego forms a lens or filter that bends external and internal stimuli into shapes it can handle . The ego complex of the healthy Western , post-Enlightenment individual is cognitively imperialistic in its effort to master all phenomena . This style of ego is the perfect partner to a cosmology that imagines a universe in which the conquest of phenomena through rational understanding is the ultimate good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object . Where can ineffable mystery reside in the domain of such an ego ? It exists in the unconscious aspect of the psyche , where its spiritual reality is enmeshed with all other unexplainable phenomena , including pathogenic material . <p> It was Jung 's opinion that the ego-dominated , rationalistic stance of the Western psyche gives rise to loss of meaning in the experience of life ( Jung 1966 ) . In this way , the disappearance of meaning from inner life reflects the disappearance of the ground of being from cosmology . His attempt to mediate this psychic structure was to emphasize the deep archetypal meaning in mythic images that emerge from the unconscious . The individual 's journey into the archetypal level of the unconscious aspect of the psyche provides a connection to the ground of being and thus a felt sense of meaning . Analytic psychologists tend to use this framework to interpret the myths of tribal cultures as though the images in those stories are manifestations of the unconscious life of the tribe ( e.g. , Sandner 's Navajo Symbols of Healing , 1979 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ego complex , this is an accurate interpretation . If they do not have that structure , it is a misrepresentation . <p> Several years ago I was visiting a friend who was pediatrician for the Indian Health Service on a Navajo reservation . We were driving through an arroyo in her truck one day , when she told me about beliefs concerning the coyote that she had encountered among her patients and their parents . She then asked me what I made of these beliefs . Clearly she was asking me for a psychological interpretation . I looked out the window to consider my answer , and there was a coyote running along the top of the arroyo , keeping pace with the truck . Before I could say anything , the coyote dashed across the path of the truck . Smoke immediately began to pour from the dashboard , and the truck shuddered to a halt . I offered no psychological interpretations to my friend concerning the unconscious meaning of coyote stories . <p> When Gunn Allen writes of the " living reality of the Medicine world " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly challenges the usual and traditional psychological interpretations of mythological symbols . Her statement that myths are " factual accounts " that " connect with deep levels of being , not because the figures they tell about are . . . denizens of . . . the unconscious but because the supernaturals live within the same environs that humans occupy " asks us to shake loose from the Western ego complex and enter into the cosmological container of Spider Woman . <p> Her statements , which are echoed by Leslie Marmon Silko and others , seem to indicate an ego complex that is not imperial in its rational conquest of the phenomenal world but which is willing to be acted on and to interact with aspects of the cosmos that can not be explained or mastered . I speculate that the psyche formed within such a cosmological container might have an entirely different relationship to nonlinear aspects of the universe . The relationship between ego and unconscious might not be an adversarial split but rather a floating and permeable one . Cosmos and psyche in such a container might reflect a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjectobject split . <p> A year after the incident in the arroyo , I again visited my friend . She continued to recount the stories told to her by her patients , but she told them with a fascination and absorption that clearly did not ask for interpretations . When I mentioned the shift in her attitude , she told me her own story . One night a very small baby who was expected to die had inexplicably rallied and lived . This was not an unknown experience for her as a doctor , and , within the culture of medicine there are accepted ways of looking at such events . For some reason , that night she realized that the accepted stance was a sort of nonexplanation , a way of putting aside a mysterious event . She began to consider her experience with the baby as a real question . Six months later that particular question was still unanswered , but , in trying to answer it , my friend had entered into a chain of questions concerning her beliefs about the nature of reality , causality , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cosmological beliefs were completely changed but several gateways had opened in its framework and a relationship with the mysterious had begun with that first question based in genuine curiosity . Such questions honestly addressed are the key to change . <p> There is a story in which the twins Monster Slayer and Born for Water meet Spider Woman on the path of the gods . She says , " Before I help you must tell me as fully as you can who you are and where you come from . You must tell me what you have done and what you hope to do " ( Zolbrod 1989 , 196 ) . The twins do not find it easy to answer her , but , when they do , they enter a new level of experience . If an individual or group is willing to articulate a detailed picture of the universe and their place in it , and especially to bring the underlying unconscious assumptions of that picture to light , room is created for previously unknown influences . As Keller describes her analysis of the construction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that we make for nature and nature 's observable phenomena . There is space as well between the ideology of inquiry and its practice ( Keller 1985 ) . Into these spaces , the process of change enters . <p> This process can take place concerning a specific aspect of worldview , or it can encompass the nature of reality . It is a process that can be triggered by a crisis , a piece of luck , an accident , an epiphany , an insight . It is not a question of choosing a story or script that is therapeutically or politically correct . Becoming conscious of and articulating the cosmological narrative that one is already living and finding its opportunities for expansion is the essence of the process . Such a narrative , when honestly mapped , contains many levels of the self . The ego is included but not exclusive . In addressing the myth and the story , we can go beyond a cognitive consideration or analysis of beliefs and beyond a catharsis of emotional reality . Exploration through narrative and image affects the internal relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the psyche processes experience , the interaction of the ego and the unconscious . <p> As the mythic narrative unfolds , a container is needed for the multiple and sometimes contradictory layers -- symbolic , somatic , emotional , cognitive , and communal -- which emerge . Myth is " explanatory of how we began and also a prescriptive account of how subsequent beginnings ( which renew the cosmos ) should proceed ; the Last Supper , for example , tells us not only how the Christian era began but how its energies can be periodically renewed " ( Young 1991 , 28 ) . A ritual act recaptures the nature of the world with its multiple layers and connects individual consciousness back to those layers least evident in the work-a-day world . The split cosmos and the split psyche are woven back into the web . Ritual practice provides a container which also feeds back into the exploration of narrative . Many activities beyond those which are typically referred to as ritual serve the same function -- art , ceremony , psychotherapy ( the ritualistic aspects of which are described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . What ever the form of the ritual , it must be rooted in the cosmological narrative in order to renew the cosmos in an evolving form ; in turn , the ritual must inform the myth . " Myth is noun , ritual is verb " ( Gunn Allen 1991 , 8 ) . NOTE <p> This paper is an aspect of ongoing work that is supported in part by a grant from the Center for the Story of the Universe . <p> 
To put Singer 's ( 1992 ) work on relative deprivation and responses to preferential treatment in context , studies from a procedural justice perspective are reviewed . That review suggests that the psychological dynamics of preferential treatment are well accounted for by concepts derived from theories of procedural justice . It is thus argued that , to be parsimonious , Singer 's work is best conceptualized in procedural justice rather than relative deprivation terms . <p> What theoretical approaches have provided us with some understanding of the social psychological dynamics of preferential treatment ? According to Singer ( 1992 ) , " . . . neither distributive nor procedural justice ! theories have been applied to fairness issues involving personnel selection or preferential hiring ( p. 130 ) . But Singer has apparently ignored that theories of procedural justice have been used to conceptualize the psychological dynamics of preferential treatment . Indeed , the evidence from studies guided by procedural justice theory is so strong that such studies constitute a standard by which new theoretical approaches to the issue should be gauged . PROCEDURAL JUSTICE AND THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of preferential treatment from a procedural justice perspective have been varied and , in the main , were undertaken in response to studies rooted in a pure distributive justice perspective . Working from equity theory , Austin , Friedman , Martz , Hooe &; Ball ( 1977 ) had claimed to show that , when individuals were led to believe that they had been selected for a position because of their gender , they evaluated their own selection as unfair . The notion was that , if an individual was selected because of his or her gender , that would mean that the individual 's outcomes ( i.e. , getting the position ) would not be commensurate with her or his inputs ( i.e. , their technical qualifications ) . In view of their findings , Austin et al . concluded that " the procedure of affirmative sexual discrimination renders situations unfair even when normal standards of distributive justice are satisfied : ( p. 292 ) . <p> Nacoste ( 1985 ) took exception to the conclusions drawn by Austin et al . He argued that , since those researchers had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment , it was premature to claim that they had shown that the " procedure of affirmative sexual discrimination " is viewed as unfair by recipients of the gender-based favorable treatment . Working from the then relatively new procedural justice literature , Nacoste argued that one could differentiate between classes of preferential selection procedures . Specifically , he argued that a procedure of preferential treatment could be designed to give an absolute advantage to members of a certain group ( e.g. , women ) , while another procedure could be designed to give some weight to membership in that group while still giving significant weight to technical qualifications . The former procedure would ignore " equity inputs " ( e.g. , completion of high school ) , whereas the latter procedure would give those " equity inputs " significant weight without ignoring group membership . As Nacoste put it , " the distinction between the two is at least analogous to the distinction ( made in the procedural justice literature ) between an equity and a legalistic procedure " ( p. 228 ) . Given this procedural justice connection , Nacoste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " would be perceived as fairer by beneficiaries of preferential treatment and cause those beneficiaries to have more positive emotional responses to being selected . Using a manipulation of procedure that was true to that conceptualization , Nacoste provided strong empirical support for his hypothesis . Even with individual qualifications varied , selection procedure had independent effects on the perceived fairness of the process and outcome as well as beneficiaries ' affective responses . <p> Following that work , a number of other studies were conducted . Nacoste &; Lehman ( 1987 ) showed that the level of evaluation apprehension that might be experienced by beneficiaries of preferential treatment varied with type of selection procedure . A selection procedure that did not give weight to equity inputs ( i.e. , a nonequity procedure ) as compared to one that did ( i.e. , an equity procedure ) increased the level of evaluation apprehension experienced by beneficiaries . When a nonequity procedure was used , beneficiaries expected that relevant others would not evaluate their work objectively and positively . <p> Working from both the research on procedural justice and interdependence theory ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) addressed a question raised first by Touhey ( 1974 ) and secondly by Heilman &; Herlihy ( 1984 ) . The question : What are the conditions under which preferential treatment might negatively affect beneficiaries ' interest in an occupation or an organizational position ? Taking an approach different from any other proposed , Nacoste argued that individuals use procedures as a basis or cue for inferring an organization 's " disposition toward fairness . " He argued further that those inferences are important because they would influence the extent to which an individual would be attracted to formal association with the organization . Using the same manipulation as employed by Nacoste ( 1985 ) , this study found that , ( 1 ) based on the selection procedure used , beneficiaries do indeed make inferences about an organization 's disposition toward fairness , and that ( 2 ) the most important predictors of beneficiaries ' attraction to an organization are those procedure-based inferences ( Nacoste , 1987a ) . <p> These studies ( Nacoste , 1985 ; 1987a ; Nacoste &; Lehman , 1987 ) focus on the role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they include concrete manipulations of procedures . But that is not much of a limitation , since it has been shown that beneficiaries ' prior evaluations of the fairness of the procedures of preferential treatment affect beneficiaries ' self-evaluations of ability when their selection by preferential treatment is made salient ( Nacoste , 1989 ) . Finally , as an aside , it is worth noting that some of this work has been replicated directly and extended to racial target groups ( e.g. , Arthur , Doverspike , &; Fuentes , 1992 ) and that , because of this work , the relevance of procedures in preferential treatment is being acknowledged generally ( Ayres , 1992 ; Tougas &; Beaton , 1992 ) . <p> We should be aware , of course , that the foregoing studies of the relationship between procedural justice and reactions to preferential treatment focused on the responses of potential beneficiaries . That fact notwithstanding , there is at least one published study that focused on the role of procedural justice in the responses of nonbeneficiaries . In the context of voting behavior , Nacoste ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also affected by the type of procedure used in making personnel selections . He argued that reactions to Walter Mondale 's selection of Geraldine Ferraro as his running mate in a U.S. presidential election would be affected by an individual 's prior beliefs about , and evaluations of , affirmative action procedures . Procedures dictated by policies of preferential treatment would be relevant , Nacoste thought , because so much attention had been focused on " why " Ferraro was selected : was it her qualifications or her gender ? Following and extending the conceptualization of procedures developed by Nacoste ( 1985 ) , this study ( Nacoste , 1987b ) measured ( 1 ) college students , beliefs about how much weight was generally put on technical qualifications vs. group membership ( e.g. , gender , race ) in an afffirmative action procedure ( average procedure ) and ( 2 ) college students ' tolerance for the use of group membership as a selection criterion in an affirmative action procedure ( unacceptable procedure ) . Controlling for a variety of factors important to voting behavior ( for example , political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vote , discrepancies between the Average-procedure and the Unacceptable-procedure were strong predictors of tendencies to vote for the Mondale/Ferraro ticket . A respondent became less inclined to so vote in response to Mondale 's selection of Ferraro when the respondent thought that the Average-procedure gave the same or more weight to group membership , which the respondent evaluated as unacceptable . As importantly , those voting inclinations were a strong predictor of the final pattern of voting by study participants in the 1984 presidential election . PARSIMONY IN PSYCHOLOGICAL POLICY ANALYSIS <p> Clearly , the evidence is that the reactions of both beneficiaries of preferential treatment and others are affected by procedural justice considerations . Thus , there is no basis for Singer 's ( 1992 ) assertion that no work has been done on the relationship between procedural justice and psychological responses to preferential treatment . In fact , the ability to use procedural justice as an approach to the responses of both beneficiaries and nonbeneficiaries suggests that a procedural justice approach has the potential to be comprehensive . <p> But what makes procedures so powerful in this context @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach for work that follows in this domain ? In an important theoretical advance , Barnes Nacoste ( 1990 ) has argued that , like other procedures , procedures of preferential treatment or affirmative action are responded to " as a function of the degree to which evaluation criteria are structured within a selection procedure to give ' voice ' to each individual 's claims to deservingness of an outcome " ( p. 182 ) . The theory behind this claim is that : <p> Affirmative action selection procedures will be made up of two general sets of criteria : traditional qualifications and group membership , or universalistic and particularistic criteria , respectively . Universalistic criteria are criteria that are thought to be achieved and performance-related ( e.g. , experience ) . . . In procedural justice terms , these are " voice-related " criteria because consideration of these criteria gives voice to each person 's claims to achieved and lto performance-related deservingness of the outcome ( e.g. , a promotion ) . Particularistic criteria are not thought to be performance-related ( e.g. , ethnicity ) . . . Particularistic criteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not relevant to achieved , performance-related deservingness . <p> According to Barnes Nacoste , any combined use of these criteria will constitute a procedure of preferential treatment . Moreover , <p> To the extent that universalistic criteria are given the most weight , beneficiaries and nonbeneficiaries will perceive the policy to be fair because such a weighting structure gives " voice " to each person 's performance-related claims to deservingness . However , where particularistic criteria are given the most weight , the policy will be perceived to be unfair because a selection procedure so structured " silences " the performance-related " voice " associated with each individual 's credentials ( pp. 182-183 ) . <p> This theoretical approach is obviously supported by the research reviewed . As already indicated , in the Nacoste program of research , universalistic- ( or equity-based ) procedures were perceived as fairer than particularistic- ( or nonequity-based ) procedures . But what support is there for this " voice " interpretation ? From very early on in the procedural justice literature ( Thibaut &; Walker , 1978 ) , it has been shown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to present individualized claims to an outcome ( for a recent overview see , Lind &; Tyler , 1988 ) . That is seen most clearly in the higher preference that individuals generally express for procedures that give them process control -- i.e. , control over the arrangement and presentation of their claims . When individuals have such process control or " voice , " not only do they perceive the procedure as fairer and are more satisfied with the procedure , but they also evaluate those acting in their behalf and the decision maker as more competent ( Thibaut &; Walker , 1975 ; pp. 67-80 ) . Aside from the effects on perceived fairness of process and outcome that we have seen for different procedures of preferential treatment , further evidence supportive of the voice interpretation comes from procedural effects on perceived competence of decision makers . In Nacoste 's 1985 study , subjects who thought that the selection committee had used a universalistic-procedure were more likely to believe that the committee was competent in carrying out its duties . Apparently , similar to that for other procedures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which gives significant weight to voice-related decision criteria is taken as an indication of competent decision making . <p> Given the existence of what appears to be a comprehensive theoretical approach in the form of procedural justice , the value of new contributions to this literature must be evaluated in light of that approach . We should ask , is the new contribution distinct from the dominant framework ? If it is not distinct , is the new contribution consistent with the dominant framework ? <p> Although couched in terms provided by theories of relative deprivation , Singer 's ( 1992 ) work is not operationally distinct from the work done on the influence of procedural judgments on reactions to preferential treatment . Singer has essentially manipulated procedure at the level of the weight given to decision criteria . Rather than manipulate the overall structure of the procedure , indicating what decision criteria are supposed to be used and in what weighting arrangement , Singer manipulates and tests the effects of the actual decision criteria used . In a selection for training context , that is accomplished by providing information about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gender group membership . The trainability score is obviously the universalistic decision criterion and group membership the particularistic decision criterion . Singer 's results also follow what would be expected from the procedural justice approach to reactions to preferential treatment ; to the extent that the particularistic criterion appears to be given more weight than the universalistic criterion , the final decision is evaluated as less fair by those disadvantaged and advantaged by this positive weighting of group membership . <p> On the one hand , then , there is no reason to consider Singer 's work as other than another demonstration of the role of procedural justice in responses to preferential treatment . To accept the relative deprivation interpretation Singer offers is simply not parsimonious . Specifically , the latter would require us to violate in our inductive logic , the " requirement of total evidence . " Putting it directly , before accepting any new conceptual interpretation , " the total evidence available must be taken as basis for determining the degree of confirmation " ( Carnap , 1952 , pg . 211 ) . In this case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empirical relations already developed from a procedural justice conceptualization . <p> On the other hand , Singer has made a contribution by providing a very important confirmation of one implication of the procedural justice approach to the psychology of preferential treatment . In two conceptual statements by Barnes Nacoste ( 1990,1992 ) , it is strongly implied that there should be a linear relationship between the weight given to universalistic relative to particularistic decision criteria . Whereas some empirical suppoti for this theoretical expectation has emerged ( e.g. , Nacoste , 1985 ) , that support has been indirect . So Singer has taken the critical step of demonstrating in full the expected linear relationship between procedural stntcture and psychological responses to preferential treatment . <p> 
##4001355 On the basis of both previous and recent research on intercultural perceptions ( Lee &; Ottati , 1993 ; Triandis &; Vassiliou , 1967 ) , it is hypothesized that perceived group homogeneity would be intimately related to familial loyalty ( or commitment ) and stability . A cross-cultural questionnaire study was conducted both in the People 's Republic of China ( n=182 ) and in the United States of America ( n=182 ) . The results revealed that both Chinese and American subjects perceived a collectivistic society to have more familial commitment and stability while they perceived an individualistic society to have less familial commitment and stability . The implications for this study have been discussed . <p> As the divorce rate in the United States rose surprisingly from the 1950s to 1980s , the issue of marriage and the family seems increasingly important to research . Ostensibly , marriage and the family have an effect on the quality of life . Because of this , much work has been done on love and intimacy ( e.g. , Clark &; Reiss , 1988 ; Fromm , 1956 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see O'Leary &; Smith , 1991 ) . However , little attention has been paid to cross-cultural research on why one culture ( such as the United States ) has a higher divorce rate than another , and on whether culturally different people would have a different degree of their family commitment and stability . <p> Many social scientists have argued that socio-cultural context has much impact on familial loyalty and marriage stability ( see Bellah , Madsen , Sullivan , Swidler &; Tipton , 1985 ; Dion &; Dion , 1988 ; Triandis , 1990 ; Yang , 1986 ; Yee , 1989 ) . Some research has even suggested an influence of culture and religion on familial responsibility and stability ( e.g. , Brodbar-Nemzer , 1986 ; Cherlin &; Celebuski , 1983 ; D'Antonio et al. , 1982 ; Hsu , 1983 ) . For instance , Brodbar-Nemzer ( 1986 ) has found a relationship between divorce and group commitment . That is , American Jews who had a greater group commitment on a variety of Jewish variables ( e.g. , denomination , ritual observance , synagogue attendance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were consistently less likely to have been divorced . <p> Although the study by Brodbar-Nemzer indicated that Jewish culture and religion had an influence on American Jewish familial loyalty and marriage stability , would non-Jewish Americans agree that , because of Jewish culture and religion , Jews are more committed and loyal to their families than non-Jewish people ? Unfortunately , his research did not address this question . The current study attempts to test whether there would be a perceptual agreement between culturally different subjects as far as familial loyalty and marriages stability are concerned . <p> In social sciences , it has often been argued that Chinese culture is collectivistic while American culture is individualistic ( e.g. , Fairbank , 1987 ; Hsu , 1983 ) . Consistent with this position , Triandis and his colleagues ( Triandis , 1990 ; Triandis , McCusker &; Hui , 1990 ) have found that in individualistic cultures , people put much emphasis on values and interests that serve the self by making the self feel good , be distinguished , and be independent . These people more likely tend to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other hand , in collectivistic cultures , people stress values and interests that serve the ingroup by subordinating personal goals for the sake of preserving ingroup integrity , interdependence of members , and harmonious relationships , and the self is usually defined in ingroup terms ( also see Triandis et al. , 1988 ) . <p> Furthermore , Triandis , McCusker and Hui ( 1990 ) pointed out that one of the distinctions between collectivistic and individualistic cultures was that people in a collectivistic society tended perceived ingroup members to be homogeneous while people in an individualistic society tended to perceive the ingroup to be heterogeneous . In their cross-cultural research , Lee and Ottati ( 1993 ) have also found that both Chinese and Americans perceived Chinese people to be homogeneous and perceived Americans to be heterogeneous . Triandis ( 1990 ) also reported similar results among Chinese mainland residents and American Illinois residents . <p> If people emphasize " homogeneity " or collectivity socially , it may suggest that the loyalty to or harmoniousness with an ingroup ( e.g. , family , work group or community ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goals or interest over society or group ( e.g. , family , work group or community ) , it means that the self/individuality and personal pleasure are important . <p> Research by Buss and 50 other cross-cultural psychologists all over the world ( Buss et al. , 1990 ) also showed that people from collectivistic cultures such as China , India and Iran valued " chastity " and " good house keeping " in selecting matches , whereas people from individualistic cultures such as France , America and Spain stressed " personal pleasure " and " exciting personality . " When love and marriage are primarily seen as psychological satisfaction in individualistic cultures , they may fail to fulfill their social function of providing people with stable , committed relationships that tie them into the larger and more homogeneous society/entity . For example , it was reported that Americans got much " happier " with their marriage relationship in the 1970s and 1980s than in the 1950s , but the rate of divorce has increased ( Bellah et al. , 1985 , p. 85 ) . <p> Moreover , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Services , the divorce rate per 1,000 population remained 4.7 in 1990 , and between 1970 and 1990 the proportion tripled from 47 divorced persons per 1,000 married persons ( with spouse present ) to 142 per 1,000 ( Wright , 1992 ) . Dion and Dion ( 1988 ) explained that Americans ' high rate of divorce was possibly due to the culture 's exaggerated sense of individualism in society or due to much emphasis on one 's individuality and independence from their group ( e.g. , family ) . <p> Seligman ( 1991 ) also pointed that much individualism and the waxing of the self in the United States coincided with a diminished sense of community and loss of higher purposes ( e.g. , less family stability ) . Similarly , Bellah et al . ( 1985 ) stated , " The meaning of one 's life for most Americans is to become one 's own person , almost give birth to oneself , " and much of this process involves breaking free from their families , communities and inherited ideas ( p. 82 ) . <p> On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their families as shameful and/or at least as negative ( Hsu , 1953 , 1963 ) . They derive the meaning of the self from their relationship to others and perceive themselves to be similar to or at least part of a group/family ( Tu , 1985 ; also see Yee , 1989 ) . Therefore , on the basis of the foregoing discussion , it is reasonable to assume that perceived group homogeneity would be positively correlated with familial loyalty and stability . METHOD Subjects <p> The sample consisted of 182 subjects in the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) and 182 subjects in the United States of America ( USA ) . Within the Chinese sample , there were 162 students and 20 teachers . This included 20 subjects from the Changsha Railway Institute ( Southern China ) , 75 from Hunan Normal University ( Southern China ) , 49 from Beijing Normal University ( Northern China ) , 17 from the Beijing Management College ( Northern China ) , and 21 Mainland Chinese students from elsewhere . The sample encompassed a variety of academic majors or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Management , Mathematics , Chemistry , Physics , and Engineering . The average age of the Chinese sample was 27.2 . There were 104 male subjects and 78 female subjects . A total of 26 subjects got married while the rest of them were single . The Mainland Chinese subjects received the questionnaire from their academic instructors . <p> The American data were collected from 182 American college students . These subjects were approached in class and received the questionnaire from a research assistant . As with the Chinese sample , the American sample encompassed a variety of academic majors . These included Psychology , Sociology , Biology , Chemistry , and Engineering . There were only 6 subjects who got married . Eighty four of the American subjects were male and 98 were female . The average age of the American sample was 21.2 . Measures <p> The questionnaire items included measures of perceived group homogeneity and perceived family commitment and stability . The measure of perceived group homogeneity was also used in the study of Lee and Ottati ( 1993 ) . In measuring both perceived group homogeneity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the items along a five-point ordinal scale ranging from " strongly agree " ( 1 ) to " strongly disagree " ( 5 ) . <p> Perceived Group Homogeneity . After subjecting the homogeneity items to tests for accuracy and reliability ( see accuracy and reliability results below ) , the pool of items was reduced to 12 measures as the independent variable . Specifically , these perceived homogeneity items were extracted from a cross-cultural questionnaire through a factor analysis ( see Lee &; Ottati , 1993 ) . In order to assess perceived group homogeneity , the following items were administered : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Thus each subject responded to a total of twelve **25;684;TOOLONG items . Translated versions of these twelve items were administered to the Chinese sample . <p> Perceived Familial Loyalty/Commitment . The dependent variable in this study was family commitment . A factor analysis of these family commitment items revealed that the following items loaded strongly on the first factor for both the Chinese and American sample . These items were used to assess the perception of Sino-American family commitment and stability . PREFORMATTED TABLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American target culture were administered to both Chinese and American groups . Thus each subject responded to a total of six family commitment and stability items . The Chinese sample was given translated versions of these six items . RESULTS <p> All items were scored such that higher numbers reflect greater perceived group homogeneity , and greater familial loyalty/commitment and stability . Sums of the appropriate items were also computed in order to arrive at indices of total group homogeneity and total familial loyalty and stability . Accuracy and Reliability of Measures <p> Accuracy of Translation . The English version of the questionnaire was translated into a Chinese version by the author of this article . The author is a native of Mainland China who has known English for over 12 years and has resided in the United States for the past six years . In order to check the accuracy and consistency of the English and Chinese versions , both versions were administered to 22 Chinese bilinguals who had studied English for an average of 10.4 years . The bilingual judges rated the translation for each item as very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or very inaccurate . On the basis of their ratings , 72% of the judges rated these items as " very accurate " or " accurate " ; 20% rated these items as " hard to be evaluated " ; and only 8% rated these items as " inaccurate " overall . Because the author understands Sino-American emics ( i.e. , culture-specific aspects ) and etics ( i.e. , culture-common aspects ) , the results of this evaluation method should be as valid as the outcome of back translation or multiple translation procedures ( Brislin , 1986 , 1993 ) . <p> Homogeneity Scale . In order to assess the internal consistency of the homogeneity scale , an alpha coefficient ( Cronbach , 1951 ) was computed for the American and Chinese samples separately . The alpha for the American sample was .73 and the alpha for the Chinese sample was .71 . In sum , the homogeneity scale satisfied fairly stringent criteria with regard to both accuracy and internal consistency . <p> Familial Loyalty/Stability Scale . The item set , which taps a familial loyalty and stability measure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese ( alpha=.69 ) and American sample ( alpha=.58 ) . Basic Sino-American Findings <p> The results from the Chinese sample indicated a significant correlation between perceived Chinese homogeneity and Chinese familial loyalty and stability ( r = +.20 , p < .01 ) and a significant correlation between perceived American homogeneity and American familial loyalty and stability ( r = +.30 , p < .001 ) . In the American sample , there was only a significant correlation between perceived Chinese homogeneity and Chinese familial loyalty and stability ( r = +.17 , p < .05 ) , and the relationship between American homogeneity and American familial loyalty and stability was very weakly correlated ( r = +.07 , ns ) but not significant . <p> Moreover , Chinese subjects scored higher in Chinese familial loyalty and stability ( M = 9.31 ) than in American familial loyalty and stability ( M = 2.97 ) , t ( 181 ) = 28.67 , p < .0001 . In a similar vein , American subjects reported that Chinese had more familial loyalty and stability ( M = 8.74 ) than Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = 11.89 , p < .001 ( see Table 1 ) . This supported the hypothesis . <p> As noted previously , the Chinese culture , which was collectivistic , was different from the American culture , which was individualistic . This cultural difference was reflected in the results both in the Chinese and in the American sample -- i.e. , strong evidence of the close relationship between perceived homogeneity and familial loyalty and stability . DISCUSSION <p> Based on the previous data , this study revealed that perceived group homogeneity was correlated with the judgments of familial loyalty/commitment and stability , and that both Chinese and American subjects reported that , the more homogeneous a culture was perceived to be , the greater perceived familial loyalty and stability it might have . In other words , the results both from the Chinese and from the American sample showed that Chinese families were seen as more stable and Chinese people were seen as more loyal to their families than American counterparts . <p> The current results may be due to different cultural ideologies . For example , according to Bellah and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans believe the individual has a primary reality where a group or society is a second order , a derived or artificial construct ( p. 334 ) . On the other hand , there is a totally different ideology of family commitment and marriage stability in Chinese culture . To many Chinese , a group ( e.g. , family , clan , or community ) is always a part of his selfhood and is a place where he or she always stays ( Tu , 1985 ) . For example , a Chinese may think family commitment and marriage stability are more important than his or her personal interest or pleasure . This ideology is possibly based on Chinese Confucianism ( Lee , 1991 ; Tu , 1985 ) . Fairbank , an American sinologist wrote : <p> The Chinese are collective , seemingly eager to be just like one another , to work together and not separately , to conform and not deviate , and to get their satisfaction from the approval of the group and constituted authority rather than from realizing private ambitions or any form of self-indulgence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within group , not apart from it , is of course not a transient vogue but the product of many centuries of Confucian family collectivism , now redirected to serve the people ' ( Fairbanks , 1987 , p. 96 ) . <p> Moreover , Chinese people usually reprimand or at least hold a very negative attitude toward those who deviate from an ingroup ( e.g. , a family or community ) while Americans do not . Take divorce for example . American men and women " can marry as often as they are widowed or divorced , and there is no significant stigma against either " ( Hsu , 1963 , p. 193 ) . In China , the pressure from a family , from a community , and from peers ( e.g. , friends or colleagues ) is very severely put on those who will get or have gotten divorced . The divorced people are usually stigmatized . <p> Although the data here revealed that perceived group homogeneity were related to familial loyalty/commitment and stability in this cross-cultural survey , other explanations deserve discussion . One of them is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger than Chinese subjects . But by analysis of variance , age was not a significant mediator of our dependent measures . <p> Another interpretation is a " kernel of truth " ( Allport , 1954 ; Triandis &; Vassiliou , 1967 ) . That is , perceptions or stereotypes of a social group are based on the objective characteristics of the target group . Some social stereotypes or social perceptions may have a component of veridicality ( Funder , 1987 ; Jussim , 1991 ) . In other words , it is possibly true that Chinese may have a lower rate of divorce than Americans regardless of whether Chinese are perceived as homogeneous or not . <p> Nevertheless , we need to realize that , due to an open-door policy in recent years , the People 's Republic of China has become more and more exposed to Western cultures and ideology . As a result , the concept of the self in China today also is changing ( Chu , 1985 ) . Chinese families now are less stable than before . It was reported that the rate of divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ await further research . <p> In conclusion , the results of this study suggested that perceived group homogeneity is related to the judgments of familial loyalty and stability . That is , Chinese and American college subjects perceived Chinese to have more familial loyalty and stability whereas they perceived Americans to have less familial commitment and stability . These data may be due to different cultural ideologies . Also , as Mainland China changes , its family structure and stability will change . <p> 
##4001477 Letter series and number series tests , consisting of items based on identical rules , were administered in a counterbalanced design to 320 ( 160 female and 160 male ) undergraduates in order to investigate the gender differences in inductive reasoning ability measured by letter and number series tests . Results indicated that female college students obtained significantly higher ( p < .05 ) means on letter series tests , but showed no such superiority on number series . <p> Gender differences in biosocial and behavioral attributes constitute a lively area of scientific debate and research . Some reviews of research ( Maccoby &; Jacklin , 1974 ; Maccoby , 1990 ) seemed to indicate some replicable gender differences in performance on tests of mathematical and spatial abilities , but other aspects of intellect seemed to be equal in the two genders . Other reviewers ( Hyde , Fennema &; Lamon , 1990 ) concluded that gender differences in mathematics performance were small and favored females in samples of the general population . Girls showed a slight superiority in computation at or below the middle school level , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college on complex problem-solving tasks . Also , the magnitude of the differences in mathematics performance in favor of men has declined over the years ; studies published since 1974 have shown difference only about half as large as that indicated by studies published in 1973 or earlier . <p> A number of problem-solving tasks ( e.g. , probability concepts or probability learning tasks , matrix items , and letter series or number series items ) involve cognitive processes that are common to the traditional psychometric instruments , sequential information processing tasks , and mathematical problem solving . Letter or number series items are considered a measure of inductive reasoning ability ( Thurstone , 1938 ) and a convenient vehicle for illustrating a theory for the acquisition of rules for sequential patterns ( Simon &; Kotovsky , 1963 ) . Letter or number series items involve mathematical operations whose frequency and complexity can be manipulated to construct very difficult sequential patterns or problem-solving tasks ( Butterfield , Nielsen , Tangen &; Richardson , 1985 ; Quereshi , 1960 ; Quereshi &; Fisher , 1977 ) . <p> It seems that items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , offer unusual opportunities for investigating certain theoretical and practical problems in both cognitive psychology and psychometrics . Although letter or number series tests have been used in a number of well-known group ability batteries such as Primary Mental Abilities ( PMA ) ( Thurstone , 1938 ) , studies comparing female with male samples on letter or number series tests have not been reported in the PMA technical reports or any other relevant published source . <p> If there are no gender differences in performance on letter or number series items , we have available a universe of gender fair items for measuring inductive reasoning . In addition , a theory for the acquisition of rules for sequential patterns can be considered applicable to all regardless of their gender . We therefore attempted to investigate the gender differences in performance on letter series and number series tests in college undergraduates . We hypothesized that college women and college men would have equal means on letter series as well as number series tests . METHOD Subjects <p> Three hundred twenty undergraduates ( 160 women and 160 men ) from an introductory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study in exchange for some extra points toward their course grades . Chronologically , they were between 18 and 25 years and , ethnically , 97% were white and 3% were Asian American . Material <p> The Michill General Ability Test ( MOAT ) ( Quereshi , 1960 ) is a standardized test that has two forms ( LA and LB ) , each consisting of 44 letter series items . The two forms have parallel-form reliability of about .80 and concurrent validity ( correlation with Wechsler full-scale IQ ) of about .60 in samples of over 100 ( Erstad , 1988 Quereshi &; Fisher , 1977 ; Quereshi &; Ostrowski , 1985 ) . With the letter series items in MGAT forms LA and LB as the guides , we constructed two new forms NA and NB , each consisting of 44 number series items , such that each item in NA or NB was identical to a corresponding item in LA or LB in both composition and rule except that it employed two-digit numbers as the constituent units . Procedure <p> All 320 persons ( 160 women and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 40 women and 40 men ) each but each person was assigned to a given group on a random basis . Group 1 ( n = 80 ) first completed the letter series form A ( LA ) and then the number series form A ( NA ) ; group 2 ( n = 80 ) first completed the NA and then LA form ; group 3 ( r ' = 80 ) first completed the letter series form B ( LB ) and then the number series form B ( NB ) ; and group 4 ( n = 80 ) first completed the NB and then the LB form . The tests were administered in a counter-balanced order during a single 2-fur session under essentially power conditions . Each 44-item test was accompanied by five practice problems and the following instructions : <p> Each problem in this test is arranged according to a certain rule of its own . You are to discover the rule and then provide the last letter/number in the row . See that there is a dot ( . ) at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row that you have to find out . Write this letter/number clearly in the space provided for answers . Data Analysis <p> Because we wanted to investigate the differences between the two genders on letter series and number series separately , the data were subjected to a 2 x 2 multivariate analysis of variance ( MANOVA ) , with gender and forms as the two independent variables of two categories each and the letter series and number series as the two dependent variables . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION <p> The MANOVA results are given in Table 1 . Although the multiple Fs are significant ( . p < .05 ) for both main effects ( gender and form ) , our major concern is the gender main effect as exhibited by either of the dependent variables ( letter series and number series ) . The univariate F ratios for the gender main effect show that the differences between the two genders are significant beyond the .05 level on the letter series tests but not on the number series . Examination of the means for the two genders indicates that the letter series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . <p> Because the interaction is not significant , the interpretation of the gender main effect is quite straightforward . We have found that , in our sample of college undergraduates , women have obtained significantly ( p < .05 ) higher scores on inductive reasoning as measured by letter series items , but no such difference exists on the number series tests . <p> Maccoby and Jacklin ( 1974 ) , after reviewing research dealing with gender differences on inductive/deductive reasoning , reached the following conclusions : <p> We have been unable to locate studies made since 1966 in which standardized reasoning tests have been given to subjects of high school age or older . The evidence from earlier work is that sexes do not differ on such measures as the reasoning subtest of the Primary Mental Abilities test . The two studies with this age group . . . show an advantage for females , but taking these studies in combination with earlier work , the overall picture remains one of little or no sex differences . ( pp. 108-110 ) <p> There are , however , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to 1966 , no studies could be located in which female adolescents or young adults were compared with male adolescents or young adults on PMA . Second , the PMA technical reports never presented either any data by gender or demonstrated the nonexistence of gender differences on reasoning or any other abilities measured by the PMA . <p> Even a more recent and comprehensive review ( Hyde , Fennema &; Eamon , 1990 ) does not provide any directly relevant information regarding the gender differences on cognitive tasks involving sequential patterns because letter/number series items are usually a part of tests of intelligence rather than tests of mathematical performance reviewed by Hyde et al . On the other hand , solutions of sequential problems may be conceptually similar to some tasks in mathematical problem solving and , thus , we could compare our results with some of those presented by Hyde et al . ( 1990 ) : <p> There was in the area of mathematical problem solving a slight female superiority or no gender difference in the elementary and middle school groups ; however , a moderate gender difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups . ( p. 148 ) <p> In contrast , our results seem to indicate female superiority in sequential problem solving , using letter series items , even at the college level . In addition , we found no gender difference in sequential problem solving involving number series items in our sample of college students . <p> Halpern ( 1992 ) asserts that , " Evidence from a variety of sources supports the finding that , on the average , females have better verbal abilities than males " ( p. 64 ) . Our finding might be interpreted to indicate that female college students ' superiority on verbal skills may be generalizable to other processes ( e.g. , reasoning ) if they are tested by sequential semantic units . This should be an important finding if it is corroborated by further research , especially that involving different cultural and ethnic groups . In any case , any such differences mainly reflect the impact of cultural and social beliefs and practices at a given point in time , in the history of a given society , and require no elaborate explanation rooted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : March 1 , 1993 .

##4001478 This paper reports on the development of an Inventory of Managing Skills designed to provide working MBA students with a current assessment of their managing skills . A canonical correlation matrix reporting interrelationships between the 20 scale dimensions in a pilot sample of 378 respondents is reported . The Inventory can be used for self assessment by students and for other-assessment by the student 's superiors and peers . BACKGROUND <p> This paper reports on the development of an Inventory of Managing Skills ( IMS ) designed for use by working graduate students as an aid in forming an assessment of their current levels of management skills . Such an assessment could be helpful in tailoring short and long term career plans . <p> The need for a tool of this type arises from the increasing interest of graduate business faculties in providing students with opportunities to enhance individual management skills , such as decision-making , supervising , leadership , and communication . The American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business ( 1984,1989 ) provided a stimulus in 1976 when the " Outcome Measurement Project " was initiated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along two dimensions : cognitive knowledge and personal management skills . With respect to the skills enhancement objective , Smith and Mortenson ( 1988 ) undertook the development of specific course experiences aimed at helping students assess their current levels of management skills , plan developmental activities that respond to individual needs , and engage in skill development exercises on an in-class basis . <p> Procedures and methods generally employed for management skills assessment include assessment centers , situational tests , and paper-and-pencil inventories which use the self-assessments of the subject and/or assessments of the subject by others ; these may be used in combination to enhance process reliability . Since there are no commercially available management skills assessment inventories suitable for self or other assessment use with graduate students who are working adults , it was decided to develop an appropriate instrument . <p> The primary purpose of such a skills assessment inventory would be to provide the student with information on his/her current level of skill in each of several relevant management skills dimensions , supplementing assessment and evaluation information from other sources . Data from student skills inventories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other important respects : as a program evaluation device and as input to curriculum development deliberations . METHOD <p> To be useful for these purposes , a skills inventory should meet several design criteria . It should ( a ) tap several dimensions of behavior/skills that are relevant to supervisory and management jobs across multiple levels of responsibility , ( b ) measure such dimensions with acceptable reliability , and ( c ) present the self-assessor and other-assessors with an uncomplicated response task , perhaps requiring no more than about one hour to complete . <p> Dimensions and Items . An initial inventory design decision was made to present the respondent with a large number of specific behavioral items which relate to several broad dimensions of supervisor/management job performance . A variation on typical job analysis procedures was used to identify both the set of dimensions to be built into the inventory and the component items . <p> First , a review of the literature on supervisory or managerial behaviors , skills , and other personal characteristics was conducted , focusing on those elements that relate to successful job performance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted involving groups of management and business school faculty , engineering school faculty , human resource management ( HRM ) administrators and executives , staff , operating and engineering supervisors/managers , and human resource development experts . Finally , the investigator drew on personal observations and judgments formed over an extensive career in HRM staff and technical management positions . <p> In each inquiry , the primary concern was to identify those supervisor/manager job behaviors , skills , and other attributes that characterize the performance of successful managers across several levels of responsibility . Based on these inputs , judgments were made identifying 20 dimensions of managing skills , involving 115 inventory items , for inclusion in the research draft of the Inventory of Managing Skills ( IMS ) . <p> Importance Analysis . As a further check on the relevance of the items selected for inclusion in the research draft of the IMS document , a special inventory form was prepared to obtain the item importance judgments of graduates of the University of Michigan-Dearborn MBA and Master of Engineering programs . A copy of the special inventory was mailed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; persons receiving master 's degrees between 1960 and 1989 were included . <p> The special inventory contained the same set of 115 items used in the student-peer-supervisor IMS documents , with appropriate modifications . Subjects were asked the question " How important is each of these items to successful performance on jobs like yours ? " Responses were made using the following five-point scale : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> A personal data section was included in this inventory , asking for advanced and undergraduate degree fields and dates , and current job assignment . Returns were received from 61 MBA graduates and 93 Master of Engineering graduates . The response rate was approximately 49% . Assessment Task <p> The 115 items were randomly sequenced within the IMS . Two inventory formats were developed : A student self-assessment format on which the respondent recorded her/his responses to inventory items , and an other-assessment format on which the student 's work supervisor ( or a work peer ) could assess the student . Students distributed the other-assessment documents to their supervisors and to peers of their own choice ; each inventory packet contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , preprinted envelope in which the supervisor or peer could mail the completed form directly to the investigator . <p> In the self-assessment format , the student was asked to read each item and assess his/her level of skill in the designated area by recording a candid judgment using one of the following five rating categories : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> This rating scale format was used on the inventory forms given to peers and supervisors with appropriate modifications of personal pronouns and verbs . Similarly , item wordings were adjusted slightly in the different formats to use appropriate language . <p> Each inventory form carried the student-subject 's name . A short personal data section was included at the end of each form of the inventory . The self-assessment form asked for job level and type and undergraduate degree . Peer and supervisory raters were asked to indicate the number of months ' work experience they had with the student . <p> A total of 156 graduate business students submitted self-assessment inventories , representing about 80% of the students who were offered the opportunity to participate . Responses were also received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; none of these raters indicated less than five months ' experience with the ratee , and all were included in the data set . RESULTS <p> Dimensions and Items . Item-dimension relationships and dimension scale reliabilities were analyzed in a two-staged process , combining the responses of students , peers and supervisors ( Nunnally , 1978 ) . <p> First , product-moment correlations were calculated between each item and each a priori dimension scale score . Any item that exhibited its highest correlation with the dimension to which it had been assigned on an a priori basis was retained ; eight items were removed from the IMS on this criterion . Next , the impact of each item on dimension reliability was assessed . Alpha values were calculated for each dimension , including and excluding each component item ; any item that did not add to its dimension alpha coefficient was dropped ; four items were removed on this criterion . The final dimension alpha values were judged to be acceptable and are shown in Table 1 , along with a listing of the final IMS dimensions and the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the IMS document was reduced in length from 115 items to 103 items . <p> A matrix of interdimension correlation coefficients is presented in Table 2 . <p> Graduates ' Importance Ratings . The item importance responses provided by the 152 MBA and Master of Engineering graduates were tabulated and averaged ; dimension scores for each respondent were calculated . <p> Two item-screening criteria were utilized . To be included in the final IMS item set , each item must achieve an average rating of at least 3.00 across the total sample , with a rating range which included one or more 5-ratings ( Critically Important ) . All items met these conditions . <p> The relatively small samples of business and engineering graduates precluded detailed cross-tabulation analysis , a cooperative research project is under way to obtain a larger graduate data pool . It might be of interest , however , to review the rank order of dimensions as determined from average dimension importance scores calculated across the entire sample ; that rank order is shown in the dimension lists in Tables 1 and 3 . Problem Solving and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc . DISCUSSION <p> Through the processes described here , an Inventory of Managing Skills was developed for use as a tool for self-assessment and other-assessment of working graduate students in business and engineering . Scale reliabilities are acceptable , and the inventory 's content validity characteristics are enhanced both by the process used in identifying items/dimensions and by the ratings of graduates whose present jobs are said to involve the items included in the IMS . Interdimension correlations are high , particularly among the " soft skills " areas , such as leadership , group interaction , and interpersonal effectiveness , probably due to the fundamentally positive interrelationships between these types of skills among effective supervisors and managers . <p> Informal contacts with respondent students and graduates suggests that the IMS has face validity . Inventory completion times of 45-65 minutes were reported . <p> The Inventory of Management Skills is intended to be used in combination with other assessment processes , such as situational tests and assessment center techniques . To the extent that additional measures are available on those skill dimensions considered to be among the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is value to self-assessment , together with assessments by work associates ; the impact is multiplied when supplemented by other sources of evaluation .

They spoke of poisons exuding from toxic waste dumps ... the pollution of air , water , soil ... extinction of plant and animal species ... deforestation ... spreading deserts ... the suffering in animal laboratories and farm factories ... chemical additives in food and drink ... friends and relatives dying from spreading epidemics of cancer . <p> The ecological crisis these developments produce does not stand apart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common thread weaving through issues of the arms race and human oppression . Just as concentrations of wealth push the poor onto marginal , easily erodable lands , so does the drive for profit demolish our oxygen-producing forests and put carcinogenic pesticides and preservatives into our food . And so does manufacture of weapons threaten us with the radioactive horrors of our own Chernobyl disaster . The four Defense Department reactors are of similar design to the Soviet one that burned out of control ( with graphite and no containment domes ) , the only difference being that ours are older and more decrepit . Yet they are kept in operation to produce plutonium for the 17,000 additional missiles that the Reagan administration wants to build . Our addictions to profit and power , and to the lifestyles they sustain , turn the world toxic . <p> These addictions culminate in an ecological crisis that is the ultimate expression of a human mistake . It is a mistake about our place in the order of things , the delusion that we can -- as corporations or as nations or as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we are put here to rule , aloo ! from the rest of creation . It is the fantasy that we can be immune to what we do to other beings . It is the denial of our deep systemic interdependence . <p> Fortunately , another perspective is emerging as a healing corrective . Ecology teaches us that we humans are neither the rulers nor the center of the universe , but are imbedded in a vast living matrix and subject to its laws of reciprocity . " Deep ecology " is a term coined by Norwegian philosopher Arne Naess , to contrast with " shallow environmentalism , " a band-aid approach applying piecemeal technological fixes for short-term human goals . Deep ecology represents a basic shift in ways of seeing and valuing , a shift beyond anthropocentrism . <p> Anthropocentrism means human chauvinism . Similar to sexism. but substitute human race for man and all other species for woman . <p> When humans investigate and see through their layers of anthropocentric self-cherishing , a most profound change in consciousness begins to take place . Alienation subsides . The human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relief then ! The thousands of years of imagined separation are over and we begin to recall our true nature . That is. the change is a spiritual one ... sometimes referred to as deep ecology . -- John Seed <p> <p> There are , of course , manifold ways of evoking or provoking this change in perspective . Methods for inspiring the experience of deep ecology range from prayer to poetry , from wilderness vision quests to the induction of altered states of consciousness . The most reliable , perhaps , is direct action in defense of Earth . <p> In deep ecology workshops there are three genetic approaches that I have found especially suitable for groups . They consist of mourning , then remembering , then speaking from the perspective of other life-forms . <p> Deep ecology remains a concept without the power to transform our awareness , unless we allow ourselves no feel -- which means feeling the pain within us over what is happening to our world . The workshop serves as a safe place where this pain can be acknowledged , plumbed , released . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is slipping away -- ancient forests and clean rivers , birdsong , and breathable air . It is appropriate , then , to mourn -- for once at least , to speak our sorrow and , when appropriate , to say goodbye to what is disappearing from our lives . As participants let this happen , in the whole group or in small dusters , there is hopelessness expressed . There is also something more : a rage welling up and passionate caring . <p> Only if one loves this earth with unbending passion can one release one 's sadness . -- Don Juan in Carlos Castaneda 's Tales of Power <p> <p> Our interconnectedness emerges as the ground of this anger and grief . Why else do we weep for other beings and those not yet born ? There 's no cause for so great a sadness if at root we are not one . Deep ecology serves as the explanatory principle both for the pain we experience on behalf of our planet and its beings and for the sense of belonging that arises when we stop repressing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As organic expressions of life on earth , we have a long and panoramic history . We are not yesterday 's children , nor are we limited to this one brief moment of our planet 's story ; our roots go back to the beginning of time . We can learn to remember them . The knowledge is in us . As in our mothers ' wombs our embryonic bodies recapitulated the evolution of cellular life on earth , so we can now do it consciously , harnessing intellect and the power of imagination . We can reclaim our history in order to know afresh our deep ecology . <p> As your memory improves , as the implications of evolution and ecology are internalized and replace outmoded anthropocentric structures in your mind , there is an identification with all life . Then follows the realization that the distinction between life and lifeless is a human construct . Every atom in this body existed before organic life emerged ... Remember our childhood as minerals , as lava , as rocks ? <p> Rocks contain the potentiality to weave themselves into such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do we look down upon them with such a condescending air . It is they that are the immortal part of us. -- John Seed <p> <p> Certain methods help trigger this remembering . Guided visualizations can take us through our four and a half billion year story , making it present and vivid . One form this can take is the Gala Meditation I adapted from letters from John Seed , who is a member of Interhelp Australia and director of the Rainforest Information Center . Sometimes we use a drum to sound a heartbeat , suggesting our connection with the pulse of life in all beings through time . <p> Our evolutionary journey can also be explored through body movement . Nosing , crawling , wriggling , pushing up , we can begin literally to feel the inner body sense of amphibian and reptile and lower mammal , because these earlier stages of our life are imbedded in our neurological system . John Seed and his colleagues in Interhelp Australia accord a lot of time to this exercise , allowing participants to move through many previous evolutionary forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was striking , " reported one , " was that modern human was the most disconcerting to me . " <p> It is to be noted in this connection that nonhuman memories can surface with particular intensity and authenticity when consciousness is altered by special accelerated patterns of breathing . Stanislav and Christina Grof developed what they call holotropic breathing to permit subjects to recapture and resolve significant experiences surrounding their birth . They have found that the material that comes to light often goes beyond the biographical and even the human realm to include phylogenetic sequences and episodes of conscious identification with other species and life forms . These are so real as to produce remarkable insights into specificities of animal behavior , botanical processes , and even inorganic interactions of inanimate matter . A version of this breathwork has been used to similar effect in the Eco-Breath workshops held in Australia . <p> This we know . The earth does not belong to man ; man belongs to the earth . Whatever befalls the earth befalls the sons of earth . This we know . All things are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things are connected . -- Chief Seattle <p> <p> Ordinary . consciousness is certainly sufficient to allow us to shake off for a while our solely human identification and imaginatively to enter the experience of other life-forms . It is as satisfying to do this as to resurrect a half-forgotten skill or sing , after years , a once familiar song . The workshop helps us feel our way . We choose -- or , as I prefer to put it , let ourselves be chosen by -- another life-form . We give it our attention , we give it our voice , we practice speaking for it in small groups where others , listening , can elicit from us more . We play tapes of environmental sounds , sometimes let hoots and howls , wind and water noises , come through our throats , hearken to inner intuitions , stretch to see and feel what lies just barely beyond our human knowings . <p> The Council of All Beings is the culminating ritual form , in which participants formally speak on behalf of these other beings . Because it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing and always different . It originated in Australia in early 1985 , after a Despair and Empowerment workshop that included environmental activists . These " rainbow warriors " had done direct action on behalf of Earth , interposing their bodies to stop French nuclear testing in the South Pacific and to protect the remaining stands of rainforest in New South Wales and Queensland . John Seed was one of them , and the Council of All Beings resulted from our encounter . <p> It is not all that strange to imagine ourselves in nonhuman forms and draw fresh vision from them . Poets and children do it , shamans and primal people know that gift . The Lord Buddha himself , it is believed , developed his perfection of compassion through numerous animal incarnations ; the Jataka at " birth " tales of his lives in such forms as rabbit , monkey , tiger , elephant , serve still as models of bravery and selflessness . The interconnectedness -- or , more precisely , the interexistence -- of all beings is expressed in the Buddhist vision of reality known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ node of the net , each being like a gem reflects all the others , as those for their part mirror back all the rest , the reflections catching back and forth . <p> Today explorations into quantum physics , systems theory , holography and morphogenetic fields offer similar perspectives on the structure of the universe . The many transbiographical and trans-species experiences occuring throughout his years of psychophysical work with people have led Dr. Graf to conclude that : <p> In a yet unexplained way each human being contains the information about the entire universe or all of existence , has potential experiential access to all its parts , and in a sense is the whole cosmic network , as much as he or she is just an infinitesimal of it , a separate and insignificant biological entity . <p> It follows then that deep ecology can empower us . As we open to the radical interrelatedness of all that is , fresh vision and vigor can be gained for our work in the world . Actions on behalf of Earth are strengthened , less limited by self-doubt , self-interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am protecting the rainforest " develops to " I am part of the rainforest protecting myself . " And it is good that that is so , for the crises we confront in this planet-time demand more of us than business-as-usual . They require depths of wisdom and courage that appear to exceed our individual resources . Yet these become available to us , as we break free of the prison cell of isolated human ego and open to our deep ecology . <p> In religious language and experience , the sense of being sustained by a source beyond our self , by a power that is not our own possession , is known as grace . In this time of almost overwhelming peril , grace comes -- as indeed it always has -- in many forms . One of them is the Council of All Beings when , near the end , a shift occurs . <p> A voice -- the ritual leader 's -- speaks on behalf of the humans , those who at any point are sitting silent in the center of the circle , listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow-creatures . We know we are wrecking the world and we are afraid . What we have unleashed has such momentum now , we do n't know how to turn it around . Do n't leave us alone , we need your help . You need us too for your own survival . Are there powers you can share with us ? <p> Without any other announcement , this plea signals a turning . The beings in the circle respond spontaneously , <p> I , lichen , work slowly , very slowly . Time is my friend . This is what I give you : patience for the long haul and perseverance . <p> By offering them , naming them , the participants in the ritual invoke the powers within themselves that they want strengthened . These powers are available to us all because they inhere in the web of life and because , in the final analysis , that web is what we are . By virtue of the long planetary journey we have made , and the processes still at work within us , that deep ecology is our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it now in this time of danger . <p> It is a dark time . As deep-diving trout I offer you my fearlessness of the dark . <p> I , lion , give you my roar , the voice to , speak out and be heard . <p> I am caterpillar . The leaves I eat taste bitter now . But dimly I sense a great change coming . What I offer you , humans , is my willingness to dissolve and transform . I do that without knowing what the end-result will be ; so I share with you my courage too . <p>
